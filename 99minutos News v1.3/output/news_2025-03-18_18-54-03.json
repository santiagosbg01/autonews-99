    "content": "President Donald Trump's plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce have hit some snags.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesA federal judge ordered the Trump administration to reinstate roughly 25,000 federal employees.The temporary order is the latest example of the fight over President Donald Trump's mass firings.DOJ filings in the case also provide extensive details about the terminations thus far.New documents filed by the Justice Department shed light on just how far the White House and its DOGE office have gone in trying to cut probationary staff from the federal government.In declarations from 18 departments or agencies, officials said roughly 25,000 federal workers had been terminated across the government. Their disclosures are the largest insight yet into mass reductions that have become the signature focus of President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.Agency officials were required to file the declarations by Monday night in a legal case brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general which allege that the mass firings were illegal. US District Court Judge James K. Bredar previously granted the attorneys general request to temporarily restrain the Trump administration from fully carrying out the terminations.Many of the roughly 25,000 employees were put on administrative leave following their reinstatement, according to the filings. Some agencies have struggled to notify fired workers that they can come back. An IRS official said they had resorted to sending out certified mail.Agency officials repeatedly warned that complying with Bredar's order could cause chaos, especially if the temporary block is lifted and the workers are fired again. Even if employees can return to work, many officials said in the filings any reinstated employee would have to go through the onboarding process again, requiring them to obtain security badges, complete training, and receive whatever equipment they needed for their jobs. Some of the agencies said they don't have enough office space.The White House targeted probationary employees with less than two years of experience in their roles as early as Inauguration Day. Probationary employees are typically easier to terminate since they lack some civil service protections.The DOGE office was not directly responsible for the Office of Personnel Management memo that prompted agencies to review the status of their probationary employees. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the de facto leader of the DOGE office, has championed mass firings and claimed credit for at least some efforts to reduce the size of government, namely the US Agency for International Development (USAID).Here are the agencies that have been hit the hardest so far, according to the filings.Treasury DepartmentThe Treasury Department terminated 7,605 out of roughly 16,663 probationary employees.The IRS is by far the largest affected Treasury agency with 7,315 terminated employees.The Department of Treasury, the second-oldest Cabinet department, manages federal finances, ensures financial security, and, through the IRS, collects taxes.Agriculture DepartmentThe Agriculture Department terminated roughly 5,714 employees.The department said that on March 12, it reinstated all of the affected employees and put them on administrative leave as part of a phased plan for them to return to work.USDA is responsible for food, nutrition, and rural development.Health and Human Services DepartmentThe Department of Health and Human Services terminated 3,248 out of roughly 8,466 probationary and trial period employees. Many of those employees were immediately put on leave, some with no set end date.HHS said it has reinstated 88 employees and extended the leave of 2,855 others. Others were allowed to return to work. Additional employees were reinstated because they were found not to meet the definition of a probationary employee.The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for promoting the health of Americans. Among the largest agencies in HHS are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which focuses on preventing diseases, the FDA, which ensures the safety of food and drugs, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare and helps administer the federal portion of Medicaid.Veterans AffairsThe Department of Veterans Affairs terminated 1,900 of roughly 46,000 probationary employees. After a review, this was narrowed down to 1,683 employees.The VA said it continues to try to notify those 1,683 employees of their reinstatement but has been unable to reach all of them.The Veterans Affairs Department is the second-largest Cabinet agency. It is responsible for healthcare and other services to veterans.Interior DepartmentThe Department of Interior terminated 1,712 employees, including 1,303 probationary workers.The Interior Department said it has canceled terminations for roughly 90% of the 1,710 employees terminated during their probationary or trial period. The department said it will not reinstate two employees who are covered by the order.The Interior Department manages public lands both through the Bureau of Land Management, which awards commercial leases, and the National Parks Service, which manages national parks and many national monuments and historic sites.Commerce DepartmentThe Department of Commerce terminated 791 of roughly 9,000 total probationary or trial period employees.The department said 27 employees were reinstated within days of firing \"for various operational reasons.\" The department said it had notified the other 764 employees of their reinstatement.The Commerce Department helps promote economic growth and includes a wide range of agencies, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Census Bureau, the latter of which is responsible for planning and administering the once-a-decade census.Transportation DepartmentAccording to its filing, the Department of Transportation terminated 788 probationary employees.The department said only 775 were affected by the court order. The remaining employees were either fired for performance reasons (2), already had their terminations rescinded (8), resigned (2), or accepted a deferred resignation program (1).The 775 employees have all been notified of their reinstatement. The department said it would place all affected workers on leave through March 19 to allow time to coordinate their return, including returning government equipment and issuing new ID cards.The Transportation Department is responsible for managing the nation's transportation infrastructure, including agencies like the FAA and Federal Highway Administration.Energy DepartmentThe Department of Energy terminated 555 probationary employees.The department said it had canceled the termination of all of the affected employees and placed them on retroactive leave until their badging and IT status are restored.The Energy Department is responsible for national energy policy and maintaining the US' nuclear infrastructure, including the security of nuclear weapons.Environmental Protection AgencyThe EPA terminated roughly 419 probationary employees.The agency said it has notified all of the affected employees of their reinstatement. Most of the 419 workers have been put on paid leave, though some (\"including students on leave for the school year\") are on unpaid leave.Created in 1970, the EPA is responsible for enforcing environmental laws. The agency says it makes sure Americans have clean air, water, and land.General Services AdministrationThe GSA has terminated roughly 366 of approximately 812 probationary and trial employees.By Monday morning, the GSA said it had reinstated all employees, minus two who declined to return to work.Often called the federal government's landlord, the GSA helps the federal government manage contracting for goods and services.Homeland SecurityThe Department of Homeland Security terminated at least 313 probationary employees. The department did not indicate the number of total probationary workers it terminated because it said those fired for performance or conduct issues were not covered by the order.DHS said it has begun the process of reinstating more than 310 workers. One employee declined to return, while another worker was already in the process of coming back due to a deferred resignation program.Since 2001, DHS has grown to become the third-largest Cabinet agency — it encompasses everything from the Transportation Security Administration and US Customs and Border Protection to the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Housing and Urban DevelopmentThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) terminated 312 of roughly 549 probationary employees.HUD said it has fully reinstated 13 employees. The department said it has begun the reinstatement process for the remaining workers who are being placed on administrative leave temporarily.The Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for addressing housing policy and enforcing fair housing laws.Small Business AdministrationThe Small Business Administration (SBA) terminated 304 of roughly 700 probationary workers.The SBA said it quickly rehired six workers, five of which remain with the agency. One employee resigned.As for the remaining employees, SBA said had notified all 298 workers of their reinstatement. The agency said 127 workers have been reinstated and put on paid leave. Employees who were on intermittent status (164) have been put into non-pay status and will not receive back pay due to their work schedule.The Small Business Administration is a Cabinet-level agency focused on helping small business owners and entrepreneurs.US Agency for International DevelopmentUSAID terminated 270 of 295 probationary employees.USAID says it has notified the affected workers of their reinstatement. If they return to work, they will be placed on administrative leave until further notice.The international aid agency, which had operations worldwide, is different from the other 17 departments and agencies covered by the order in that it has already effectively begun to shut down its operations. USAID previously vacated its DC headquarters. The State Department has absorbed its remaining operations.There are multiple ongoing lawsuits regarding USAID's restructuring and effective gutting.Labor DepartmentThe Department of Labor terminated roughly 170 of approximately 620 probationary and trial employees.The department said all affected employees have either returned to work or voluntarily left the government.The Labor Department is responsible for enforcing federal labor laws, which, according to its website, cover over 165 million workers. The department is responsible for publishing closely-watched data on the economy and employment through the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationThe FDIC terminated roughly 156 of about 261 probationary employees.The FDIC said in its filing that five employees would have been terminated regardless due to performance/conduct issues. The remaining 151 employees have been reinstated and placed on administrative leave.The FDIC is an independent federal agency funded primarily by fees banks pay. It is primarily known for insuring bank deposits, which is part of its mission to maintain the financial system's stability.Consumer Financial Protection BureauThe CFPB terminated 117 probationary employees.The CFPB has reinstated all of the affected employees who are now on administrative leave.The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, the CFPB is a consumer watchdog. The agency has shut down its DC headquarters amid a Trump administration move to end its operations. Musk previously called for the CFPB to be deleted.Education DepartmentThe Department of Education terminated 65 of roughly 108 probationary employees.The department has processed reinstatements for the employees.

    "title": "Trump Gets a Taste of Putin’s Tactics",
    "url": "tag:theatlantic.com,2025:50-682092",
    "content": "Vladimir Putin isn’t going to make this easy for Donald Trump.For weeks, Trump has bragged about his close relationship with his Russian counterpart and declared that Putin wanted to bring a quick end to the war that he, of course, started more than three years ago. Trump’s national-security team worked with Ukraine to come up with a 30-day cease-fire proposal in hopes of persuading Moscow to accept it. And his press secretary declared yesterday that Ukraine and Russia were on the “10th yard line of peace.”But when the two men spoke today, Putin had his own ideas.Putin did agree during the more-than-two-hour call to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, and he pledged to continue negotiations. But that limited deal fell far short of what the White House had forecast in recent days, and it now confronts Trump with a dilemma. In order to secure the peace he has promised, he might have to engage in something he has yet to do: get tough with Putin.Trump, predictably, dressed up his call with Putin as a win, posting on social media that the conversation was “a very good and productive one.”The peace process “is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!” he wrote.In truth, Putin offered next to no concessions, and his goal, according to a Kremlin readout of the call, remains maximalist: preventing Ukraine’s rearmament and sovereignty. In order for him to accept Trump’s full cease-fire proposal, Putin said, Ukraine would have to stop rearming its military and sending new soldiers to the front lines, and all foreign governments—including the United States and Kyiv’s European allies—would have to stop sending military assistance or intelligence to Ukraine.[Read: Trump is Nero while Washington burns]Taken together, those demands would severely weaken Ukraine’s ability to defend itself, and Trump did not agree to them in the call. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking with reporters in Ukraine after the Trump-Putin call, expressed “skepticism” about Putin’s motivations and made clear that no lasting deal could be made without his nation’s involvement. Still, he added, “if there is a partial cease-fire, this is a positive result,” and he signaled that Ukraine would accept the limited agreement, even though it would allow Russia to continue to pummel his nation’s cities and towns.If the strikes on energy infrastructure indeed stop, it would be the most significant mutually agreed suspension of attacks in the war. A senior White House aide framed that to me as a major achievement, the first step toward a broader peace (Trump long ago abandoned his campaign promise to end the war in 24 hours). But Trump’s national-security team will now need to debate a course of action, and the aide, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations, conceded that difficult decisions lie ahead. Will Trump allow the U.S. to pressure Moscow—by toughening sanctions on Russia or increasing aid to Ukraine—to push Putin to soften his demands? Or will Trump once more defer to Putin and isolate Kyiv?The partial cease-fire holds benefits for both sides. Ukraine has struggled for years with Russia’s attacks on its energy grid, which at times have plunged cities into darkness and cold. But agreeing to the deal also was in Putin’s interest—Ukraine has recently ratcheted up its attacks on gas and oil facilities deep in Russian territory, weakening Moscow’s most crucial stream of revenue at a time when the nation’s war-weary economy is struggling.Marc Polymeropoulos, a former U.S. intelligence official who is a Trump critic, told me that Putin’s demand for an end to those strikes—and his willingness to relinquish his own military’s ability to do the same—is proof that the strikes “are having a much more severe effect than even we imagined. Putin wants them to stop. That’s a pretty good measure of effectiveness.”That’s all that Putin was willing to give up, though, and he telegraphed his intent to keep the war going or, at least, to end it only on terms that he could dictate. According to the Kremlin readout of the call, Putin insisted on the “absolute need to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,” which include, in Moscow’s view, Ukraine seeking security guarantees from the West, such as admission to NATO or the European Union. Putin also suggested cutting Kyiv out of future negotiations, leaving the talks solely between Washington and Moscow. And his demand for a complete end to all foreign military support to Ukraine is simply a nonstarter: Even though Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance have previously threatened to discontinue American support for Kyiv, Ukraine’s European partners have in recent weeks only increased their pledges.“It’s clear that Russia remains the obstacle to peace in Europe,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons told me in a statement. “I’m glad to see a halt on infrastructure strikes but many of Putin’s ‘requests’—like a ban on arms or intel sharing—make clear what he is after: a neutered Ukraine that can’t defend itself.”Of note: Neither the White House’s nor the Kremlin’s readout of the call described any discussions between the two leaders over the fate of the territory Russia has seized from Ukraine. Russia has claimed about 20 percent of Ukraine’s land, beginning with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Air-raid sirens continued to go off around Ukraine today. Still, the call yielded some positives for Ukraine, which will at least for now continue to receive U.S. assistance as it tries to work out backup plans with Europe in case Trump eventually cuts off Kyiv.“Frankly, this is the Russian playbook of using negotiations as an instrument of armed conflict,” Polymeropolous, the former intelligence officer, told me. “But in the grand scheme of things, it’s probably less bad than everyone imagined. At least the U.S. didn’t sell Ukraine down the river.”[Read: Trump is offering Putin another Munich]Few in the national-security community are counting on Trump to suddenly align himself more solidly with Kyiv. For weeks, he and his administration have embraced Moscow’s view of the war in Ukraine. Trump has decreed Zelensky “a dictator,” repeated Putin’s lie that Ukraine started the conflict, declared that Ukraine didn’t have any “cards” in the negotiations, and already denied Kyiv’s top wish—that it be allowed to enter NATO, the alliance designed as a bulwark against Russian aggression. The pause in U.S. intelligence-sharing and shipments of military supplies to Ukraine earlier this month allowed Moscow to make gains on the battlefield, most notably in the Russian territory of Kursk, land that had been Ukraine’s strongest bargaining chip in possible upcoming negotiations. And, of course, in Trump’s first term, his administration at times levied tough sanctions against Moscow only to be undermined by the U.S. president’s warm words for Putin, including during their infamous 2018 Helsinki summit.So far, Trump hasn’t done anything to suggest that he’s cooling on Putin. When Zelensky didn’t give Trump everything he wanted in their Oval Office meeting last month, the U.S. president berated his Ukrainian counterpart, and Trump’s allies called for new elections in Kyiv. When Putin didn’t give Trump everything he wanted today, the Russian leader still got a friendly Truth Social post from Trump, pledges of further talks, and possibly some hockey games featuring the best players from each country.But there were signs that Trump wasn’t happy with how Putin played his hand. Trump has rarely missed opportunities to chat with reporters during the first eight weeks of his presidency; just yesterday, he fielded questions multiple times, including when predicting that Putin wanted peace, and he often boastfully engages with the press while signing executive orders.Another such signing was scheduled for the Oval Office this afternoon. But reporters were not invited to watch, depriving them of the chance to ask questions about the Putin call. Trump remained behind closed doors.",

    "title": "Google’s Pixel Tablet is $120 off ahead of Amazon’s spring sales event",
    "url": "https://www.theverge.com/?p=631847",
    "content": "\n\nAmazon’s latest promo applies to both the dock and dock-less configurations, too.\n\nAmazon’s next Prime Day event likely won’t occur until July; however, that hasn’t stopped the retail giant from launching a slew of seasonal promos. The next one comes in the form of Amazon’s Big Spring Sale, which kicks off on March 25th and runs through March 31st. And, in typical Amazon fashion, we’re already seeing a number of early deals on Bose headphones, Fire TV devices, and video doorbells.\nThe bulk of the discounts we’ve seen thus far are pretty ho-hum — that is, aside from the current promo on Google’s Pixel Tablet, which is on sale at Amazon with its speaker dock starting at $399 ($100 off) or without the magnetic dock for an all-time low of $279 ($120 off). If you prefer a retailer other than Amazon, you can also grab the base-model tablet from Best Buy and Google for the same price.\nDespite having launched in 2023, Google’s latest slate is still arguably the best Android tablet available. Google’s app ecosystem isn’t as robust or as optimized for larger screens as Apple’s, but the Pixel tablet is still a great device for streaming, browsing the web, and some light gaming. The Google-made Tensor G2 processor is speedy and reliable, and thanks to the tablet’s four-speaker sound array, you actually get some decent stereo separation. The optional dock charging dock provides even fuller sound while allowing the tablet to function as an ad hoc smart display, which is handy if you want to control your smart home devices via Google Assistant or the tablet’s 11-inch LCD display. \nRead our Google Pixel Tablet review.\nMore ways to save today\n\nThe Amazfit Active 2 is probably the best bang for your buck as far as fitness trackers go, but if you want something truly minimalist, the Fitbit Inspire 3 is on sale at Wellbots for $74.95 ($25 off) with promo code VERGE25. It’s a pretty basic fitness band, though you do get Fitbit’s excellent sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. It’s also outfitted with a bright OLED display and up to 10 days of battery life with the always-on display disabled, which, frankly, isn’t something you’re going to get with most smartwatches. Read our impressions.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20th; however, if you want to save on Ubisoft’s latest open-world title, the Xbox Series X / S version is already available for preorder at Newegg for $59.99 ($10 off) when you use coupon code ACSPPXD at checkout. Based on our time with the game, it’s more of a refinement of previous titles than a complete reinvention, but it’s nice to see Ubisoft finally embrace the setting fans have been clamoring for since the franchise’s inception. Well, that and the welcome return of the dual protagonist system from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.\nIf you’re looking for a budget drawing tablet, Wacom’s One 12 pen display is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart with its customizable stylus for $249.95 ($50 off), matching its all-time low. The 11.6-inch display packs 1920 x 1080p resolution with 99 percent sRGB coverage, and unlike most display tablets geared toward creative professionals, it uses a single USB-C cable for connectivity. It also supports Windows, macOS, Android, and Chrome OS, so you shouldn’t run into any trouble regardless of which OS you prefer.\n\n",

    "url": "https://www.theverge.com/?p=632264",
    "content": "\n\n\n\n“The Strange $55 Million Saga of a Netflix Series You’ll Never See,” reported in 2023 by the New York Times, is now a criminal matter, as today prosecutors in the Southern District of New York charged director Carl Erik Rinsch with wire fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They allege that after Netflix (referred to as Streaming Company-1 in the indictment) won the bidding for his 13-episode show, it paid $44 million over the course of 2018 and 2019 to produce the sci-fi series about a species of superintelligent humanlike clones. \nAccording to the Times report, Netflix secured the show by offering millions more than Amazon and promising Rinsch, whose only feature film is 47 Ronin, final cut. \nThe fraud he’s being charged with came into play once he told Netflix he’d need an additional $11 million to finish the show, which was originally called White Horse before it was renamed Conquest. After Netflix sent the money in March of 2020, however, Rinsch allegedly took the money for himself, putting $10.5 million in a brokerage account and losing more than half of it in less than two months while telling Netflix that work on the show was “awesome and moving forward really well.” \nHe had better luck with the rest of the money, making crypto investments starting in the spring of 2021 that prosecutors say “eventually proved profitable.” However, as detailed by the Times, his behavior became erratic, and after Netflix canceled development in 2021, he sent executives emails claiming he’d found a way to map “the coronavirus signal emanating from within the earth” and told his wife he could predict earthquakes\nThey made enough money that Rinsch allegedly spent $10 million on himself, including over a million dollars to pay for lawyers to sue Netflix in an attempt to get more money, buy five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, and spend nearly a million bucks on two mattresses, bedding, and linens. According to the Times, Rinsch claimed they were props for the show, but a mediator who ruled last year that he owed Netflix $12 million decided none of them were necessary for the production.\nWhite Horse still has not been completed.\n",

    "content": "O'Brien has outlined CR's 2025 publishing push, including at least two books by the company's cofounders.Robyn Von Swank/Critical RoleThe nerdworld business Critical Role is making a big push into publishing this year.Its publishing drive, led by Liam O'Brien, includes two books written by the cofounders.Also on the 2025 slate are art books, comics, and novels written by Penguin Random House authors.Liam O'Brien — known to fans as the heartbreak prince — has worked on all parts of Critical Role's business, from writing for its animated series to live-streaming for its gothic horror gaming venture.Now, he's overseeing the company's bigger push into print.O'Brien is one of the eight leaders of the nerdworld business Critical Role. Over the past decade, he and his friends have built a multi-division geek empire that spans animation, game publishing, podcasting, streaming, and live shows.CR's book publishing dates back to 2017, when the crew released titles like their first \"Vox Machina\" art book. But now, as the company celebrates its 10th anniversary, they're making a proper go at publishing, with a full slate of books to be released in 2025.In a call from his office — which houses a massive shelf of geeky books and nerdy paraphernalia — the self-described \"literary dork\" outlined what CR's push into the publishing business will look like.2 cofounder-written kids' titlesCR plans to publish at least two children's books written by its cofounders in 2025. The first, \"Der Katzenprinz,\" is a book of fairy tales O'Brien wrote and is scheduled for release on April 8.O'Brien said the book is a collection of three dark and mystical fairytales, all grounded in the fantasy world of Exandria.\"I was just diving into fairytales, which I grew up on and love. I have books on the shelf behind me that are from when I was a kid, that are full of dark, weird stories,\" O'Brien said.The second CR cofounder-written book is \"Smiley Day: A Good Advice Book From Your Favorite Robot Therapist,\" by CR cofounder Sam Riegel. It will be released on September 30.\"When you're a parent, you read a lot of children's books — and some of 'em are great, and some of 'em were not great,\" Riegel, a father of two, told BI. \"And we thought, 'Maybe we should try to make a good one.'\"More D&D-based novelsCR has partnered with authors under the Penguin Random House stable to roll out novels based on their \"D&D\" campaigns.An early title released in 2021 under this collaboration was \"Vox Machina — Kith & Kin,\" a novel-length deep dive into the backstories of the half-elven twins O'Brien and CR cofounder Laura Bailey played on stream.The Penguin Random House slate for 2025 includes \"Tusk Love,\" a novel by Thea Guanzon, inspired by characters in CR's second long-running campaign. And there's a short story collection with a foreword from O'Brien, \"Vox Machina — Stories Untold.\"\"The team at Critical Role is incredible at telling stories, so it just made sense to expand those stories into books,\" said Elizabeth Schaefer, the publishing director at Random House Worlds.\"The setting and characters are so rich that we've been able to publish a wide variety of books—from novels to a cookbook, to a behind-the-scenes making of, to even an advice book,\" Schaefer said.O'Brien joked that he ended up taking charge of CR's literary offerings because \"the others are too busy\" — but it's all worked out since he loves books.And as part of the team's publishing drive, it's O'Brien's job to curate CR's art books. He also consults on the company's graphic novel collaborations with Dark Horse Comics.\"I grew up an avid reader, and my slippery slide into tabletop role-playing games and fantasy was through reading novels,\" O'Brien said.\"So really, my whole life has been about being a big nerd and then deciding, 'Well, I need to be an adult now,'\" he said. \"And then realizing that that was incorrect and then just fusing it all together.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

Esta iniciativa invita a los consumidores a participar en carreras virtuales, donde cada kilómetro recorrido se traduce en una donación para la limpieza de los océanos.\nAdemás de reforzar su compromiso con la sostenibilidad, Adidas logra que sus clientes se sientan parte de una causa global, al tiempo que promueve sus productos diseñados con plásticos reciclados.\nEsta activación no solo generó gran interacción en redes sociales, sino que también fortaleció la percepción de la marca como innovadora y responsable con el medio ambiente.\nLee también:\nMercado Pago cambia su logo en su nuevo rebranding\nUsuario no pierde su racha de Duolingo en medio concierto\nConductor de Uber sorprende a pasajero con “Kit de supervivencia”",

La producción, influenciada por el cómic y la cultura pop, se destacó por su estilo visual y narrativa dinámica.\nMcCracken también creó otras series exitosas como Mansión Foster para Amigos Imaginarios. Las Chicas Superpoderosas sigue siendo una de sus obras más emblemáticas, con reboots y adaptaciones que han mantenido su legado en la cultura popular.\n¿Dónde ver las Chicas Superpoderosas?\nTodos sus episodios los puedes encontrar disponibles en MAX y en Netflix, desde México, así que no hay excusas para revivir los clásicos.\n⇒ SUSCRÍBETE A NUESTROS CONTENIDOS EN GOOGLE NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/?p=3887595",
    "content": "Microsoft is testing out an interesting new aspect within the Settings of the latest Windows 11 preview build that allows users to expand the functions of various applications.\nThe app settings called “Actions,” was hidden in the 26120.3576 build for the Dev Channel. However, enthusiasts uncovered the menu and shared details of its function on various Windows forums, noting the associated apps currently include Photos and Paint. When toggled on, it enables useful tasks that deepen the functions within apps.\nWindows Central\nTo find these settings within the Windows 11 preview Go to Settings > Apps > Actions. There you will find the available options for Photos, which include Blur background, Erase objects, and Visual Search with Bing. The available options for Paint include Removes background.\nNotably, these are higher-level editing features that are typically not found in the vanilla versions of Microsoft’s software. However, the Actions settings do appear connected to the Click To Do intelligent text actions feature, which is mentioned by Microsoft within the feature log of the Windows 11 preview.\nWindows Central noted that Click To Do is exclusive to Copilot PCs, which likely means Actions would similarly be associated with coming AI PCs. Click To Do is a feature that has similar functions to the Actions settings but can be accessed by highlighting and right-clicking to trigger a drop-down menu on AMD and Intel-powered PCs.\nMicrosoft is set to roll out several Copilot+ features, starting in May, including the notable Recall feature, To Do and a feature called AI in Windows Search, in the summer, as well as more “proactive” Copilot features later in the year, the publication added.\nThe Actions settings is not guaranteed to make it as a public-facing feature; however, if it did, it would integrate some of those AI-associated features, similar to Click To Do on the OS level. As said, all of these features require Copilot+ PCs that include an NPU that can process at least 40 TOPS.\nWhile the Windows 11 preview only demos two applications, the pundits noted the potential for how other apps, particularly third-party apps, could be integrated into the Actions Settings experience for more dynamic functions.",

    "content": "You know, I’m not sure why I’m surprised. Capcom, at least you’re giving people the chance to play Resident Evil 3 Remake on any platform they choose. So, indeed, I wasn’t exaggerating about RE3 getting an unconventional release. Starting today, you can play one of Capcom’s best and brightest on… your phone! It’s now available on iPhone, Mac, and iPad.\n\n\n\nThere’s even a Resident Evil 3 mobile 67% discount you can take advantage of from now until April 16. However, I can’t say I care about the fact that it’s coming to mobile devices (happy for y’all, though). As a drama demon, I’m more focused on the fact that RE fans are not happy with Capcom. Apparently, people were expecting something with a bit more substance behind it.\n“Not worth it bc there’s nothing extra. No New DLC. We been waiting for a complete RE3 Remake and this is a s–t launched to the face really tbh.” One of the main issues players have with Resident Evil 3 Remake is that it cuts out a lot of content from the original. So, Capcom announcing a simple mobile port of the game has reopened old wounds for many.\nScreenshot: Capcom\nyes, we can play ‘resident evil 3’ remake on our phones, but what about ‘re9’?\n“Who’s playing this on their phone man. like imagine your out in public and you ask someone what their playing on their phone cause its moving at -178274783 frames per second and they tell you ‘resident evil 3’ go get a console Jesus.” …I can’t imagine RE3 will be quite the powerhouse on your iPhone, true. But, hey, you’ll be able to see Nemesis on a… smaller screen. Hmm.\n“I hope to see Resident Evil Outbreak HD Collection. I’ve collected all parts of RE and played them on all difficulty levels. I still enjoy the RE games. So, I only need RE Outbreak. I really want it.” That‘s the secret sauce, Capcom! Never mind porting RE3 — the fans have spoken! We want Resident Evil Outbreak!

    "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/?p=1856485",
    "content": "An Australian man in his 40s with severe heart failure just made medical history by being the first person to live for over 100 days with an artificial titanium heart. The artificial heart was surgically implanted to act as a stopgap measure as he awaited a heart transplant.\nThe man who declined to be identified received his implant at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney this past November. He remained in the hospital until February when he became the first person on earth to leave the hospital with the titanium artificial heart implanted. The heart kept him chugging along until a donor’s heart became available in early March.\nThe artificial heart was developed by a company called BiVACOR. The company’s Total Artificial Heart, or TAH, is less complicated than previous artificial hearts, as it only has a single moving part: a spinning rotor held in place by magnets. \nThe device takes oxygenated blood in and pumps it out to the body, as a heart should. This 3D animated rendering of how it works leaves no doubt that this thing looks like a car engine designed for a human’s chest.\n\n\n\nNo valves or bearings means fewer parts will wear out over time as the device works to replace both heart ventricles. Professor Chris Hayward of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Australia is overseeing the patient’s recovery and has been deeply involved in the TAH’s clinical trials. \nSpeaking with CNN, he said “within the next decade we will see the artificial heart becoming the alternative for patients who are unable to wait for a donor heart or when a donor heart is simply not available.”\nAs for when the TAH will be available to patients in the United States, well, good news — it’s already here. \nIn July 2024, a 58-year-old man in Texas with end-stage heart failure received a TAH. He only needed it for eight days before a donor heart became available. The device has been tested by the FDA and so far, a total of five patients have been implanted with the device in the United States.\nThe post Transplant Patient Survived Over 100 Days With a Titanium Heart appeared first on VICE.",

Cuando se realiza con éxito, el rebranding puede revitalizar una marca, aumentar su relevancia y fortalecer su posición competitiva.\nLas razones para implementar un rebranding son diversas. Algunas marcas buscan modernizar su imagen para atraer a un público más joven, mientras que otras lo utilizan para desvincularse de una reputación negativa o para reflejar un cambio en su modelo de negocio.\nArtesano crea molcajetes en formas de Pokémon\nEn un entorno de consumo cada vez más dinámico, donde las preferencias de los clientes evolucionan rápidamente, el rebranding es una herramienta clave para mantener la vigencia y responder a las expectativas del mercado.\nNo obstante, el proceso debe ejecutarse con cuidado, ya que una transformación mal gestionada puede confundir a los consumidores leales o alienar a la audiencia que ya se identificaba con la identidad anterior.\nBurger King\nUn caso exitoso es el de Burger King, que en 2021 renovó su imagen por completo después de más de 20 años. La marca adoptó un diseño retro que evoca su herencia, pero con una estética moderna y colorida que refleja su compromiso con ingredientes frescos y una experiencia más auténtica.\nEste cambio no solo modernizó su presencia visual, sino que también reforzó su identidad como una marca cercana y fiel a sus raíces, logrando una respuesta positiva tanto en nuevos consumidores como en sus clientes más fieles.\nLee también:\nArtesano crea molcajetes en formas de Pokémon\nProfeco alerta por inconsistencias en enjuagues bucales\nJefe de Siri de Apple admite retrasos vergonzosos en la IA\n ",

    "content": "Orville Peck will make his Broadway debut later this month, and he’ll be doing it without his signature tasseled mask. The country singer is starring in Cabaret as the Emcee, and he’ll be showing his full face in public for the first time to do it.\nEarlier this year, it was announced that Peck would be replacing Adam Lambert in the cast of Rebecca Frecknall’s Broadway revival of Cabaret, with Peck recently revealing that he’ll be unmasking to play the role of the Emcee when he begins his run with the show on March 31.\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club (@kitkatclubnyc)\n\n“The mask is part of my expression personally as an artist and a very big personal part of me,” he told the New York Times. “But I’m here to play this role and to bring respect and integrity and hopefully a good performance to it. It’s not about me. I’m not trying to make it the Orville Peck show.”\nWhen it comes to deciding to take off his mask for the role, Peck explained: “I wouldn’t have necessarily done this for just anything, but this is probably my favorite musical of all time.” Tye 1966 Kander and Ebb musical follows a group of hedonistic characters at a Berlin nightclub during the time that Nazis began their rise to power.\nOrville Peck Began wearing a more revealing mask in 2024\nNotably, Peck began using a more revealing mask last year, trading in his tasseled face-covering for one that removed the dangling fabric and only hid his upper face. NME reports that, at the time, he said the change “was a little nerve-wracking” and made him feel “a little naked,” but that the move necessary for him to “evolve” as an artist and entertainer.\nPreviously Peck spoke with NME about his artistry and commented on how he presents a “heightened version” of himself through his on-stage person, adding, “So it’s really sincere on one hand and on [the other] hand it’s larger-than-life, but it’s nice that those things can live side-by-side.”\nThe singer also addressed how past attempts to “unmask” impacted his artistic expression and led to criticism that was based in homophobia rather than sincere and earnest critique. “Traversing this industry as a gay country musician I already endure daily hate, bullying, aggression and people actively trying to discredit what I do,” Peck said. “All I ask is that people respect my work (and more importantly) my fans enough to maintain this crucial part of my expression as an artist.”\n\nThe post Orville Peck Will Take Off His Mask for His Broadway Debut in ‘Cabaret’ appeared first on VICE.",

    "title": "¿De cuánto es la multa del SAT si no presentas la declaración anual?",
    "url": "https://www.merca20.com/?p=12473668",
    "content": "\nEl Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) es una pieza clave en la vida fiscal de millones de mexicanos, y la declaración anual es uno de los trámites más importantes para personas físicas y morales. Sin embargo, no cumplir con esta obligación puede traer consecuencias económicas significativas. En esta nota, te explicamos qué implica este proceso, cuándo debes realizarlo, quiénes están obligados y qué pasa si no lo haces a tiempo en 2025.\n¿Qué es la declaración anual del SAT?\nLa declaración anual del SAT es un reporte obligatorio que los contribuyentes presentan para informar sobre sus ingresos, deducciones, retenciones y pagos de impuestos correspondientes al año fiscal anterior, en este caso, 2024. Este trámite permite al SAT verificar que se hayan cumplido las obligaciones fiscales y determinar si hay impuestos por pagar o un saldo a favor. Es una herramienta esencial para mantener en orden tu historial fiscal y evitar problemas legales o financieros.\n¿Cuándo se presenta la declaración anual 2025?\nPara el ejercicio fiscal 2024, las fechas límite de la declaración anual en 2025 varían según el tipo de contribuyente. Las personas morales deben presentarla a más tardar el 31 de marzo de 2025, mientras que las personas físicas tienen hasta el 30 de abril de 2025. Además, existen plazos especiales: las sociedades en liquidación tienen hasta el 17 de enero, y las personas morales sin fines de lucro, hasta el 15 de febrero. Es crucial respetar estas fechas para evitar sanciones.\nLEER MÁS: ¿Cuándo se lanza oficialmente el One UI 7 de Samsung? Esta es la fecha revelada por la marca\n¿Quién debe presentar su declaración anual?\nNo todos los ciudadanos están obligados a presentar la declaración anual. Entre quienes sí deben hacerlo están las personas físicas con ingresos superiores a 400 mil pesos anuales, quienes trabajaron para más de un patrón, freelancers que emiten facturas, o aquellos con ingresos por arrendamiento, premios o actividades empresariales. Las personas morales, como empresas registradas ante el SAT, también tienen esta obligación sin importar su nivel de ganancias o tipo de actividad.\nLEER MÁS: ¿Cuáles son los nuevos emojis de WhatsApp? Esto es lo que significan\n¿Cuáles son las multas por no presentar la declaración anual 2025 del SAT?\nSi no presentas tu declaración anual a tiempo, el SAT puede imponer multas significativas, según el Código Fiscal de la Federación. Las sanciones van desde 1,810 hasta 44,790 pesos por cada obligación incumplida, dependiendo del tiempo de retraso y la gravedad de la omisión. Además, si el SAT te envía un requerimiento y no respondes, las multas pueden aumentar, e incluso se generan recargos mensuales del 1.47% sobre los impuestos adeudados, más ajustes por inflación. Presentarla extemporáneamente antes de un requerimiento puede evitar estas penalizaciones, pero si hay saldo en contra, se sumarán intereses.\nCumplir con este trámite no solo evita dolores de cabeza económicos, sino que también mantiene tu historial fiscal limpio, algo clave para futuros créditos o trámites.\n¿Cómo saber si tengo un saldo a favor del SAT?\n\nPara saber si tienes un saldo a favor del SAT, debes revisar tu situación fiscal tras presentar tu declaración anual o consultar tu historial en el portal del Servicio de Administración Tributaria. Aquí te explico los pasos clave para verificarlo:\n\n\nPresenta tu declaración anual: Si eres persona física o moral, al ingresar tus ingresos, deducciones y retenciones en el sistema del SAT (disponible en sat.gob.mx), el simulador calculará automáticamente si pagaste más impuestos de los debidos. Al final del proceso, el sistema te indicará si tienes un saldo a favor y su monto.\n\n\nIngresa al portal del SAT: Accede con tu RFC y contraseña o e.firma. En el apartado “Devoluciones y Compensaciones”, selecciona “Consulta de devoluciones”. Aquí podrás ver si hay saldos a favor pendientes de ejercicios anteriores o del actual.\n\n\nRevisa tu estado de cuenta fiscal: En “Mi Portal” del SAT, bajo “Créditos Fiscales”, puedes consultar detalles de tus declaraciones y confirmar si hay un saldo positivo.\n\n\nSolicita la devolución: Si tienes saldo a favor, puedes pedirlo en línea ingresando tu CLABE bancaria. El SAT suele depositarlo en 10 a 40 días hábiles si todo está correcto\n\n\n\n⇒ SUSCRÍBETE A NUESTROS CONTENIDOS EN GOOGLE NEWS",

    "title": "¿Cómo conservar adecuadamente el huevo? PROFECO emite estas recomendaciones",
    "url": "https://www.merca20.com/?p=12473696",
    "content": "Foto: Gobierno de México\nEl huevo es un alimento básico en la cocina mexicana, apreciado por su versatilidad y alto valor nutricional. Sin embargo, su correcta conservación es crucial para evitar riesgos a la salud. La Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (PROFECO) ha emitido una serie de recomendaciones para garantizar que este alimento se mantenga en óptimas condiciones.\n¿Dónde se deben conservar el huevo, según la PROFECO?\nLa PROFECO recomienda que, una vez adquiridos, los huevos se guarden en el refrigerador. A diferencia de los supermercados, donde se conservan a temperatura ambiente, el refrigerador ofrece una temperatura fría y estable que ayuda a preservar la frescura y calidad del huevo. Es importante destacar que no se deben guardar en la puerta del refrigerador, ya que esta zona experimenta fluctuaciones de temperatura que pueden afectar la calidad del huevo.\n¿Dentro o fuera del empaque?\nLo ideal es conservar los huevos en su empaque original, ya que este los protege de golpes y evita que absorban olores de otros alimentos. Si no se dispone del empaque original, se pueden guardar en un recipiente limpio y cerrado, alejados de otros productos que puedan transmitirles su olor.\nLEER MÁS: ¿De cuánto es la multa del SAT si no presentas la declaración anual?\n¿Cuáles son los huevos que se deben desechar?\nLa PROFECO aconseja desechar aquellos huevos que presenten las siguientes características:\n\nCáscara rota o agrietada: Una cáscara dañada puede permitir la entrada de bacterias.\nClara acuosa: Si al romper el huevo la clara se desparrama y tiene una apariencia líquida, es señal de que el huevo ha perdido frescura.\nOlor desagradable: Un huevo en mal estado desprenderá un olor fétido.\nFecha de caducidad vencida: No se deben consumir huevos que hayan sobrepasado su fecha de caducidad o consumo preferente.\n\n¿Dónde se deben guardar el huevo en casa, según la PROFECO?\n\nEn el refrigerador: La temperatura fría y estable del refrigerador es esencial para conservar la frescura del huevo.\nEn su empaque original: El empaque protege los huevos de golpes y olores externos.\nEn un lugar alejado de otros alimentos: Evitar guardar los huevos cerca de alimentos con olores fuertes, ya que pueden absorberlos.\n\nPROFECO y la manipulación segura del huevo\n\nLa PROFECO enfatiza la importancia de la higiene en la manipulación del huevo. Este alimento puede actuar como transportador de patógenos, por lo que se recomienda:\n\nLavarse las manos antes y después de manipular huevos.\nLavar los utensilios utilizados en la preparación de huevos.\nNo utilizar la cáscara para separar la yema de la clara, ya que puede contener patógenos.\nNo dejar los huevos ni los alimentos preparados con ellos a temperatura ambiente, hay que refrigerarlos.\n\nLEER MÁS: ¿Cuándo se lanza oficialmente el One UI 7 de Samsung? Esta es la fecha revelada por la marca\nPROFECO y la cocción adecuada del huevos\nLa cocción es fundamental para eliminar los patógenos presentes en el huevo. La PROFECO recomienda:\n\nCocinar los huevos hasta que la yema y la clara estén firmes.\nNo consumir huevos crudos o poco cocidos.\nTener en cuenta que en las preparaciones con huevo, la cocción es un factor importante, ya que este proceso es la única manera de eliminar patógenos peligrosos para la salud.\n\nPROFECO y el valor nutricional del huevo\nLa PROFECO destaca que el huevo es un alimento rico en proteínas, grasas, vitaminas y minerales. Su consumo moderado, como parte de una dieta equilibrada, aporta importantes beneficios para la salud.\nSiguiendo estas recomendaciones de la PROFECO, podemos disfrutar de los beneficios del huevo de forma segura y saludable.\n⇒ SUSCRÍBETE A NUESTROS CONTENIDOS EN GOOGLE NEWS",

    "content": "The much-anticipated return of stranded NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station went off without a hitch.Williams and Wilmore flew home from the ISS along with astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, splashing down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida just before 6 p.m. ET today. The weather was crystal clear and the Atlantic Ocean described as \"glass-like\" by NASA's live feed on X.\n\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\n\nSpeed boats raced to the capsule after the splashdown of the Dragon capsule that carried SpaceX's Crew-9. NASA officials then climbed aboard the Dragon to check on the four astronauts as dolphins swam nearby (visible at the 1:33 mark on NASA's live feed). After a quick check, the capsule was hoisted onto a larger boat, the Megan, and then hosed down to wash off corrosive sea water. The hatch was quickly opened and Commander Nick Hague was the first to be extracted from the Dragon, followed by Gorbunov, Williams, and Wilmore. Less than an hour after splashdown, all astronauts were extracted and loaded onto stretchers as their muscles needed time to adjust to Earth's gravity. The return of SpaceX's Crew-9 was notable for many reasons, but the most significant was the fact that Williams and Wilmore were returning to Earth after their initial ISS trip of eight days turned into 286 days, or over nine months, thanks to their Boeing Starliner ship experiencing propulsion problems during their arrival last June. NASA will provide the media with more updates on Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov at a press conference scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET.\nSEE ALSO:\n\nNASA dropped a new report.
