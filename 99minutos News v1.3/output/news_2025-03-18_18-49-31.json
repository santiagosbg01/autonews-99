    "content": "Apple’s iPads get all the headlines, and with good reason: They’ve long been considered the best tablets for most people. But none of them come cheap. For folks on a tighter budget, I’ve spent the last few weeks testing a couple of 8-inch slates on the dirt-cheap end of the price spectrum: the $100 (but frequently discounted) Amazon Fire HD 8 and the $79 Walmart Onn 8”. They aren’t the only tablets available in this price range, but they’re pushed directly by the world’s two largest retailers, so there’s a good chance casual shoppers may buy them without knowing exactly what they’re getting. We pitted the two slates head-to-head not only to figure out which one is better, but also to diagnose the state of ultra-budget tablets as a whole. Balancing cheapness and utility You’ll never get truly “premium” hardware when you shop in this price range, but the Onn makes a nicer first impression than Amazon’s Fire tab. Squint hard enough and it sort of resembles a budget iPad mini, with a chilly aluminum back, squared-off edges and firm side buttons. Most people I handed it to over the course of this review were immediately surprised at how decent it felt for something so cheap. \n\n \n The Fire HD 8 wears its price more clearly. It’s mostly made from a hard textured plastic, with slightly thicker yet more rounded sides, thicker bezels and flimsier buttons. The front facing camera and dual speakers sit on the long edge, so it’s mainly designed to be held horizontally for streaming video or playing games. The Onn has a more traditional setup, with its selfie camera at the top and two speakers firing out the bottom edge, so it’s not as accommodating for media consumption or video calls. Despite the cheaper-feeling materials, I find the Fire HD 8 easier to hold for longer stretches. The gently curved sides don’t dig into your palms as much as the Onn’s flat edges, and while the larger bezels aren’t pretty, they give your thumbs a more natural place to sit. The Onn in particular can be prone to accidental inputs, something its thinner bezels exacerbate. That said, the Onn isn’t uncomfortable, it’s just more generic. In fact, it’s actually a half-inch narrower than Amazon’s tablet. With either device, you’re getting a tablet that’s just under 0.8 pounds — lightweight, highly portable and easy to hold with one hand. \n\n\nThe $100 Amazon Fire HD 8 (left) and $79 Walmart Onn 8\" tablet.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n The different perils of cheap tablet displays You won’t write home about either tablet’s 8-inch IPS LCD display, but the Onn’s panel is the surprisingly clear winner when you put the two side-by-side. Colors are noticeably less muted, black tones are deeper and the whole thing can get a bit brighter at its peak. White tones are too blue for me to call this screen accurate, but the Fire HD 8 tilts even farther in the other direction — it runs much warmer, which layers everything with an orange-ish hue. This makes it easier on the eyes at night, but it dulls colors, washes out black tones and generally looks dimmer by comparison. Beyond the tuning, both screens have similar drawbacks. Both are saddled with a low 1,280 x 800 resolution, which is sharp enough for displays this small but still makes text and images fuzzier than they’d appear on an iPad or pricier Android slate. Both have a basic 60Hz refresh rate. Neither is fully laminated, so there’s an air gap between the LCD and the display cover that makes scrolling feel less natural. This is especially noticeable on the Fire HD 8. (Apple’s base iPad has this same issue, but it’s an issue nonetheless.) Amazon’s tablet is also a major smudge and fingerprint magnet, plus it’s more difficult to read outdoors. The Onn doesn’t exactly excel in these areas either, but it’s better. And yet, much of the Onn’s advantage is negated by its lack of Widevine L1 support. Android Authority has a good explainer, but to simplify, Widevine is the Google-owned DRM platform used by many of the most popular video streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Paramount+ and Max. It has two security levels Android devices can support: L1 (the highest) or L3 (the lowest). If a device is only L3-compliant, like the Onn, video from these services is capped at a 480p resolution. Sure enough, shows and movies from those services are visibly less sharp on the Onn than they are on the Fire HD 8, which supports Widevine L1 and has no issues playing in 720p. This sucks. Netflix, Disney+ and the like are the apps many people buy a tablet to use, and while the Onn’s display is generally more vibrant, the difference isn’t nearly large enough to overcome video streams that look like they were ripped in 2010. A dimmer and overly warm image is still preferred if it’s the only one that supports HD across the board. Google doesn’t charge a license fee to implement its DRM tech, so there’s little excuse for Walmart — a $700 billion company — to ship a tablet that isn’t fully certified, even if it’s a cheapo model. Yet the Onn isn’t the only cheap Android tablet without full Widevine compliance. Consider it another way those on a tighter budget are let down by corporate laziness. \n\n\nThe Onn has a slightly thinner but more boxy shape, while the Fire HD 8 has more rounded edges.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n The other expected sacrifices There are several other hardware benefits you give up when you dive into the bargain bin, most of which are annoying but not terribly surprising. The cameras on both tablets are horrid, for one, blurring details and washing out colors even in full daylight. Neither tablet has a fingerprint reader for unlocking the device faster. Nor do they have formal water-resistance ratings, so you’ll want to be careful using either around the sink or tub. Both devices are equipped with a basic USB-C 2.0 port, and neither supports true fast charging. The Fire HD 8 can top up slightly quicker, as it supports up to a 15W charge compared to the Onn’s 10W, but even then Amazon only includes a 5W adapter in the box. The Fire HD 8 also has the edge when it comes to audio. It’s far from impressive: It can’t get very loud and it struggles to cleanly separate the different parts of tracks. But it’s decidedly fuller, warmer and more balanced than Walmart’s shrill speakers, which make vocalists sound like they’re shouting through a tin can. The Fire HD 8 can at least imply some level of bass too, whereas the Onn is pretty much devoid of it. The Onn also lacks a headphone jack, so you’re out of luck if you still like to keep a wired pair handy (like me). \n\n\nThe side profiles of the two tablets.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n Fast enough — barely Both the Onn and the Fire HD 8 are about as cheap as Android tablets get, and their performance follows suit. On paper, the former wins by a hair: Both come with 3GB of RAM, but Walmart’s slate runs on a 2 GHz eight-core chip (Mediatek MT8786), while Amazon’s uses a 2 GHz six-core processor (MediaTek MT8169). Along those lines, the Onn’s single- and multi-core performance was better than that of the Fire HD 8 in the Geekbench 5 benchmark (331 to 194 and 1317 to 950, respectively). In practice, however, there isn’t much difference. Both processors are as entry-level as it gets in 2025, and 3GB of RAM is the absolute minimum for passable performance. Geekbench 5 is an older version of that particular benchmark, but we had to use it because the latest Geekbench 6 straight-up doesn’t work on devices with less than 4GB of memory. With either tablet, you’re looking at light media consumption and little more. Apps, videos and ebooks load quickly enough to not completely annoy you. Web browsing is adequate so long as you don’t open more than a few tabs at a time. Casual card and match-three games play well enough, and you can run at least some more involved games like Diablo Immortal and PUBG Mobile if you knock them down to their lowest graphical settings. Streaming games over services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Amazon Luna works about as well as it does on any other device. (But we did notice that some games were capped at a lower resolution on Walmart’s tablet than they were on the Fire HD 8.) These are the kind of tasks ultra-cheap tablets are designed for, so this is what they can do. Even still, there will be hitches along the way. Pulling up the app drawer on the Onn sometimes took a second more than it should. There’s a slight but noticeable lag when you scroll down the home screen on the Fire HD 8. Multitasking or doing any serious work on either device is out of the question. Many graphically demanding mobile games won’t start at all. Some sites take frustratingly long to load, because the modern web simply isn’t designed for affordable devices like these — there are too many resource-hungry ads, images and auto-playing videos for them to truly keep up. \n\n\nThe Amazon Fire HD 8.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n If you want to keep score, the Fire HD 8 usually took just over 25 seconds to boot up. That’s slow, but still eight to 10 seconds faster than Walmart’s tablet on average. (For reference, an iPad Air M2 I had on hand took about 12 seconds to boot up.) Load times for individual apps were more of a toss-up: Some loaded a second or two faster on the Fire HD 8, some on the Onn, while others were effectively even. Ultimately, both let you do the basics without overwhelming trouble, but they always feel like they’re skirting the edge. I wouldn’t expect either to hold up well two or three years from now. One benefit of having a lower-spec device is that it won’t chew through battery life. Walmart says the Onn can last up to 15 hours, while Amazon rates the Fire HD 8 at up to 13 hours. Those are generous estimates, but both devices should last more than 10 or 11 hours on a charge with typical mixed use. The Onn survives a pinch longer between the two, but the difference is minimal. Both have enough juice to get you through a long flight. Both tablets also come with a paltry 32GB of storage, and the portion of that space that’s actually usable out of the box is even smaller: 25GB for the Fire HD 8 and just 18GB for the Onn. This means you likely won’t be able to install more than a few games to either device at any given time. Thankfully, you can add up to 1TB of room with a microSD card — a feature that is not available on any iPad — and that will be a must if you want to download a bunch of movies or songs to play offline. One caveat to all of this is that Amazon sells an upgraded version of the Fire HD 8 with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for $129. That puts it over the $100 threshold we set for this exercise, but the extra gig of memory should make everything run slightly smoother. \n\n\nThe Walmart Onn 8\" tablet.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n Good Android, bad Android The biggest distinction between the Onn and the Fire HD 8 comes down to their radically different takes on Android. With the former, it’s essentially a stock version of the OS. It’s Android 14, so it’s about to be two major updates behind, but the only app Walmart pre-installs is its own (natch) and even that is removable. Otherwise, all of Google’s core services are right there, swiping left on the home screen takes you to the Discover news feed and you can download just about any other app from the Play Store. If you’ve used an Android device in recent memory, you should be able to get around without a sweat. The tablet defaults to the Google Assistant out of the box, but you can download the company’s Gemini AI app and make that your default assistant in settings. While the chatbot isn’t as tightly integrated here as it is on Pixel devices, you can still use it to answer queries, summarize emails and webpages, generate text, create (terrible) images and so on. The Gemini 2.0 Flash model picks up voices well and runs without any serious lag to boot. \n\n\nFor the most part, the Onn runs stock Android 14. Left to right: the home screen after installing and activating Google's Gemini AI bot, the personalized Google Discover news feed you see when you swipe left on the home screen and the front page of the Google Play Store.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n Amazon, meanwhile, is still shipping its tablets with Fire OS, a heavily skinned fork of Android 11 with a custom app store and an extreme emphasis on the company’s own services. Years later, it remains obnoxious to the point of hostility. Omitting the Play Store means it doesn’t officially support any Google app, so there’s no Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Maps and the like. (While there is a YouTube “app,” it’s really just a dinky web shortcut.) Amazon’s own email and calendar apps are far less robust by comparison. Many of the major streaming and social media services are still available, but plenty of other big-name apps are not, including Reddit, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Slack, any browser besides Amazon’s extremely-basic Silk and tons of popular games. It’s still possible to install the Play Store onto a Fire tablet and sideload most of the apps you want from there, but setting that up is a pain and not every app will continue to work perfectly. More importantly, that’s not the experience Amazon is selling. Fire OS remains a platform that works best when you go behind its back. I can’t say that about stock Android. Much of Fire OS feels like it was explicitly designed to nickel-and-dime you, to sell you on everything Amazon. I’m not being hyperbolic: The first app you see upon unlocking the device is literally called “Shop Amazon,” and there’s a dedicated shortcut to the company’s storefront on the Silk browser’s home page. So many of the Amazon apps that come pre-loaded are based on a subscription — Kindle, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos, Audible, Freevee (which no longer exists), etc. — and almost none of them can be uninstalled. Swiping left from the home screen brings you to a “For You” page of content suggestions that constantly promotes those Amazon services and includes a row of sponsored apps toward the top of the page. The home screen itself has an unremovable “Discover” tab rife with similarly aimless suggestions and paid sponsorships. Most obnoxious are the lock screen ads. Every time you turn Fire HD 8 on, a full-screen ad for BetMGM, Verizon, a personalized Amazon listing or some other brand is there to greet you. Rarely do I feel like a gadget respects me less than when I see stuff like this. Sure, $100 isn’t a ton for a tablet, but it’s not nothing. When I see the same ad for my local Tri Honda Dealer for the 12th time that day, I can’t help but question who the actual product is. You can turn these ads off, but only if you pony up another $15. \n\n\nA few snapshots from Amazon's Fire OS. Left to right: a lock screen ad for Verizon, the \"For You\" page of content suggestions and the home page of Amazon's custom app store.\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n Even if you do, it’s hard to shake the sense that Fire OS only really cares about getting you to funnel more cash into the Amazon machine. Google certainly pushes its own stuff too, but many of its services are proven and widely-used. Amazon’s platform is even louder with its self-promotion yet much more locked-down. In that sense, it isn’t consumer-friendly. People who really love Amazon apps could always just download them from the Play Store on any other Android tablet. No matter which platform you use, you’ll have to put up with the usual issue with Android on tablets: Many apps look like blown-up versions of the ones you’d see on phones more than experiences designed with a larger screen in mind. This is less of an issue on an 8-inch tablet than an 11-inch one, but any iPad will be better optimized for its size. I spent a long while ripping on Fire OS, but it does have some redeeming qualities. The Alexa voice assistant is baked into the device and runs quickly enough; if you have Alexa-compatible smart home devices, you can control them here hands-free. (At some point it should also work with the souped-up Alexa+, though for now the Onn has the edge when it comes to AI support.) It’s good if you’re buying for a child too, as it lets you create a separate kid profile populated with age-appropriate apps, websites and videos. The Onn offers similar features through Google’s Kids Space mode, and both let you manage your child’s screen time and app library. But the Fire HD 8 makes those parental controls a bit easier to access, and it’s generally more proactive about locking down the rest of the device. You can also make it so your kid has to spend a set amount of time reading or using other educational material before they can play games. Looking forward, Amazon promises to supply the Fire HD 8 with security updates through 2029. It doesn’t mention anything about OS upgrades, but that’s still a decent level of support for the price. Walmart, on the other hand, hasn’t issued any software roadmap for Onn tablets, though we were able to apply a March security update earlier this month. We’ve reached out to the company for more details and will amend this review if we hear back. \n\n\n\nJeff Dunn for Engadget\n\n Wrap-up After poring over the Fire HD 8 and Onn 8 for the past few weeks, my main takeaway has become clear: You should really try to pay for something better. Get an iPad, buy an older refurbished one if you have to, pay even a little bit extra for a more powerful tablet from Samsung, Lenovo or another name brand — it shouldn’t really matter. It’ll run better, both today and into the future. And any iPad will still make better use of its screen space. But that’s not an option for most people looking to buy one of these things. If you absolutely cannot spend more than $100, I’d wait for a sale on the Fire HD 8. Yes, I loathe much of what Fire OS represents, but you can at least paper over some of its annoyances by sideloading. The design is generally comfier to hold, and while its display is subpar, the Onn’s inability to stream many popular apps above 480p makes it almost impossible for me to recommend in 2025. If you want a cheap screen for some pet project that doesn’t involve streaming, the Onn may still work: Its display quality and aluminum finish are surprisingly decent for $79, and its version of Android is far less obnoxious than Fire OS. But that seems like a smaller niche. Both of these tablets serve to highlight just how much junk cash-strapped buyers are forced to eat simply for being on a budget. In the Fire tablet’s case, you have to let Amazon seed a miniature ad box in your home, one that promotes the company and its partners every single time you turn it on. In the Onn’s case, you get what feels like a lazy rebrand of a white-label device, one that the world’s richest retailer couldn’t bother to put through all of the necessary certification processes. I know what you’re thinking: “They’re cheap tablets, what do you expect?” And yeah, if you want the good stuff, you have to pay for it. More at 11. It’s just that we’ve been saying that for a long time now. These companies have lots of money. Maybe it’s time to expect a little better.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/battle-of-the-dirt-cheap-tablets-amazon-fire-hd-8-vs-walmart-onn-8-130031544.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Assassin's Creed Shadows review: An ambitious and captivating world that's stuck in the past",
    "url": "0a878bf9-83ed-4b00-a766-b0362065a47b",
    "content": "It's unlikely that the fate of a company as large as Ubisoft will hinge on the success of one tentpole single-player game. But the company cannot afford another major error anytime soon after the likes of Star Wars: Outlaws and XDefiant failed to set the world alight. Ubisoft desperately needs a big hit (and for the Rainbow Six Siege X overhaul to go well). The good news for the company is that Assassin's Creed Shadows is poised to deliver on that.\nOn the surface, it's exactly what you'd expect: a massive Assassin's Creed game that takes dozens of hours to beat. There's so much to do beyond the core story, given all the missions and sidequests that the game constantly points you towards. I was rarely bored during my time with the game — not even during the lengthy flashbacks — which says a lot about the care and consideration Ubisoft's developers have put into this giant world and the story that ties it together.\nUbisoft could not risk having the game run poorly from the jump and then spend months fixing it à la Cyberpunk 2077. Thankfully, for the most part, Assassin's Creed Shadows runs well across my consoles (base PS5 and Xbox Series X) and PC.\n\nIt looks sumptuous on my high-end gaming rig, which has an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 14th-gen i9 Intel CPU and 32GB of RAM. I had zero issues while running everything at very high settings. The action hovered in the 55-59 fps range with no considerable framerate drops — save for the slightly jarring switch to cutscenes, which play out at 30 fps. It's worth noting that Assassin's Creed Shadows is verified for Steam Deck, but I wasn't able to test it out there.\nThere were no noticeable slowdowns even in the heat of chaotic combat on the three platforms I played on. However, I did spot some small visual aberrations on PS5. Early on, while strolling through puddles in performance mode, water pooling on a dirt track shimmered in an unnatural way. It distracted me from the conversation I was having with an ally.\nUbisoft\nOnce I was in winter, textures on the grass that poked through the snow faded out and in while I tore through the countryside on horseback. For the record, that happened in balanced mode, which attempts to split the difference between the quality and performance modes in terms of visual fidelity versus framerate. These are minor complaints, in fairness, but they momentarily broke the immersion for me.\nThe main other weird quirk is that my horse often got stuck when I whistled for it. If, say, I was on a narrow bridge when I called the steed, it might spawn into the river below. A slight annoyance that's more to do with how the horse is programmed to catch up to you by your side, but one that's forgivable considering some of the many narrow paths you'll venture along.\nTwo heroes with their own stories\n\nThe big hook this time around is that you can swap between two characters almost whenever you like. Naoe, a shinobi, is a more traditional Assassin's Creed protagonist, while the warrior Yasuke is a hulking samurai who can bust through doors and carry bodies to hiding spots more easily than his counterpart. There are missions and character interactions that require you to specifically play as one character, but for the most part, you can play as either in the open world.\nI stuck to Naoe as much as I could. She's far more nimble and capable at clambering around strongholds — her grappling hook is such a handy tool — and carrying out stealthy assassinations. After all, she’s the only one of the two who has the fabled hidden blade. Her movement is extremely fluid, an aspect of the game that's said to have benefited from the extra time developers had amid its delays.\nUnlike Yasuke, Naoe can use the classic eagle vision ability to reveal enemies, hiding spots and goodies through walls. She's plenty capable in hand-to-hand combat as well, more so as you unlock abilities like the very useful double assassination. Her kusarigama, which consists of a sickle-like implement and heavy weight linked by a chain, is a great part of her arsenal.\nThat's not to say Yasuke isn't a fun character as well. Silently thinning out enemy numbers with his bow or loudly with a teppō firearm before charging in to eliminate the remainder with a long katana, crushing club and special moves like booting a grunt into a wall never got old.\nBoth protagonists are well-written and performed, at least while playing with English audio. However, the lip syncing didn't always neatly match up with what the characters were saying, a distraction in cutscenes. While I didn't get around to playing the game in immersive mode, with characters speaking in their native tongues of Japanese and Portuguese, I'd be interested to see if the lip sync issue is as prominent there.\nPersonal stakes with a broader goal\nNevertheless, the story was strong enough to hold my attention during the cutscenes and the rest of the game. It's a tale that starts with very personal stakes for both heroes but expands to involve safeguarding the future of Japan. The writers have crafted a narrative with plenty of intrigue and intricacy, and I enjoyed how they weaved the broader Assassin's Creed lore into Shadows.\nI would say the story and structure are rich and intricate enough to justify the 40-60 hours it'll take many people to finish this game. (The new scouting system — which you'll use to narrow down the location of an objective after learning that, for instance, a target is in a specific area — works well.) Still, I preferred the tighter 20-hour approach Ubisoft took with Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nUbisoft\nI enjoyed playing in canon mode, which removed dialogue choices and let narrative beats play out as the designers intended. It's too much of a spoiler to reveal how Naoe and Yasuke come to be allies, but the interactions between them and other characters, particularly the flirty relationship Naoe has with one firearm-wielding figure, are for the most part captivating enough.\nThe performers (and, my goodness, are there a lot of speaking parts here) by and large do a great job with the material. But it's a bit jarring to hear a character speak in a plain North American accent when most of the cast bring Japanese and Portuguese inflections to their delivery.\nAs solid as the tale being told is overall, the structure is a little odd in places. The main story includes flashback sequences, including one with a combat tutorial that takes place right after the action-packed prologue, that disrupt the flow even if they add some color to the protagonists' backstories.\nSkill tree frustrations\nI'm not a big fan of the way Ubisoft has structured the progression systems. Naoe and Yasuke each have six skill trees, all of which are broken down into levels. To unlock the next level, the player has to accumulate enough experience points by completing various side activities, including horse archery and finding hidden items dotted around temples. In a vacuum, these can be fun, but it gets a little frustrating when you have a lot of spare mastery points to spend on skills and you have to run around to honor some shrines or find meditation spots before you're able to acquire some of Naoe's and Yasuke's cooler moves.\nThere are some other antiquated systems in the game. Defeating a rōnin — a samurai who has been hired to take out the heroes — in a fun fight earned me decent loot, including some legendary light armor. But I couldn't equip it, because my character hadn't quite reached a high enough level to simply put on some new rags. This doesn't make any logical sense.\nScaling enemy difficulty from region to region, a trope that Ubisoft eschewed in Mirage, feels very tired here too. It's an artificial way of ramping up the difficulty and progression when other approaches like more creative level design, new enemy types and the player manually making the game harder in their settings can do the trick. Given the historical nature of the series, it does follow to a degree that some of Ubisoft’s gameplay ideas are stuck in the past.\nIn general, I don't really care to spend my time scouring for gear upgrades just so I can stand a chance in a new area. That said, perks on certain equipment can come in handy. Skulking around castles to take out a few key enemies to unlock a chest with some valuable equipment felt rewarding — even just as a little something extra to do while I tried to make my way to a viewpoint on enemy turf. Castles are valuable strongholds and offer a defensive advantage against attackers, so it's only logical that the bad guys would be stationed around viewpoints, which reveal new points of interest visible to our heroes after they scale up to a specific perch.\nUbisoft\nEven without that gameplay aspect, scaling up to a viewpoint is always worth it, as has long been the case in the Assassin's Creed series. The minimum reward is a sweeping shot of the surrounding area, and since Shadows is such a stunner, I made it a point to claim every viewpoint along my path.\nThe aforementioned puddle and grass anomalies aside, it’s a joy to roam around this gorgeous game, with its abundant foliage, carefully assembled settlements and dynamic weather system combining to form a rich, lived-in world that I won't soon forget. The lighting systems allowing for Naoe and Yaskue to snuff out candles and lanterns to help them hide in the shadows at night were a smart addition here too.\nThere are plenty of other fun aspects to Assassin's Creed Shadows. In one moment that reminded me of a beat in The Last of Us Part II, I was just starting a peaceful side activity when an assassin tried to take me out. That was an enjoyably unexpected twist. Meanwhile, an optional fight against a high-level enemy at the foot of a blazing tower in the middle of the night felt deeply cinematic.\nThere's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows. Ubisoft will absolutely be hoping that it's a success out of the gates and that not too many players wait for the price to drop. There's plenty of competition to be concerned about too, particularly as Sucker Punch Productions' sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yōtei, is slated to arrive at some point this year.\nIt does feel like there's enough here to draw in both Assassin's Creed diehards and newcomers who may be entranced by the 16th-century Japan setting but don’t know their Animus from their elbow. Assassin's Creed Shadows has impressive technical work, great performances and an expansive, well-drawn story but it's unfortunately weighed down by some frustrating decisions and antiquated gameplay systems. Still, I'm eager to keep exploring.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Amazon Luna and Ubisoft+ on March 20. It will be available for iPad in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-review-an-ambitious-and-captivating-world-thats-stuck-in-the-past-170008367.html?src=rss",

    "title": "It's about damn time Microsoft made an Xbox gaming handheld",
    "url": "0504ba71-18e3-4bd8-b765-6148102687bc",
    "content": "It hasn’t happened yet, but if rumors are to be believed, Microsoft may be finally working on an Xbox-branded gaming handheld. In a lot of ways, portable PCs represent a perfect evolution to the company’s consoles. But with Microsoft arriving late to the party, there are a few things this device needs to get right.\nBetween Microsoft’s 20-plus year history making consoles and the Surface division’s expertise in engineering laptops and other mobile devices, you’d think creating a portable PC with a built-in screen and attached controllers would be as easy as sticking an AFK opponent with a ‘nade in Halo. And after the Steam Deck built a fort on Valve’s top sellers list since its release in 2022, there’s an obvious financial incentive for Microsoft as well. Hell, we’ve even heard about how much Xbox CEO Phil Spencer likes traveling with his Legion Go, so it’s not like this is a foreign concept to the folks in Redmond.\nRegardless, aside from the Xbox-branded gaming laptop that we’ll probably never get (MSFT please?), a handheld console makes so much sense. The Nintendo Switch has already proven that there’s a massive appetite for a device you can easily connect to a TV but still take on the go. But more importantly, Spencer has been out there for years saying “I don’t want my team’s focus on console sales. The primary outcome of all the work that we do is how many players we see, and how often they play. That is what drives Xbox.” And right now, there’s no better way for the company to grow its user base than by making its first handheld console. Not only could a portable Xbox play games locally, it could also stream titles from the cloud (via Game Pass Ultimate), serve as another home for social features like the friends list, activity feed and so much more.\nAccording to Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the device — codenamed Project Kennan — will feature a design similar to existing handhelds like the ROG Ally or Lenovo Legion Go (though it probably won’t have detachable controllers). While it appears Microsoft won’t be making the device itself, the company is said to be tapping ASUS (or possibly another OEM) to build it instead, which makes a lot of sense given the latter’s experience with the Ally and Ally X. From there, Microsoft is expected to add some “Xbox-y twists” like support for the Xbox Game Bar, Play Anywhere functionality and of course Game Pass Ultimate.\nUnfortunately, there isn’t concrete pricing or a specific release date, but it’s possible that this device could come out before the end of the year for between $499 and $599. But again, those numbers are mostly speculation, and there’s not much info regarding its screen size, processor or any other special features it might have.\nBut let’s be real, the specs for this rumored portable Xbox aren’t all that important. Right now, there are a seemingly endless number of handhelds available from companies like ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, Ayaneo and GPD, with even more on the way. So if Microsoft comes out yet with another option that doesn’t address the flaws of current devices, it won’t make that big of an impact. That’s because, for my money, the Steam Deck still feels like the best portable gaming machine on the market.\nSam Rutherford for Engadget\nWhile the Deck’s performance is often eclipsed by its Windows-based rivals, Valve’s machine offers a more polished and intuitive experience, thanks in large part to its purpose-built OS. When I use it, I don’t have to deal with annoying notifications or pop-ups that force me to awkwardly switch between various control schemes just to get into a game. On the Deck, I never have to use desktop apps (unless I want to), as Steam’s Big Picture mode (unlike Windows) was designed around a simple UI that can be navigated using joysticks instead of a mouse.\nThe most important thing Microsoft can do for its upcoming handheld is to remove or sidestep the clunkiness you run into on practically every Windows-based device. This is something the company has tried to do before via improvements to the Windows Game Bar and may revisit again with its rumored Project Bayside, which could provide a standardized framework that would allow for a more streamlined UI. But what does this actually look like in the real world?\nWhen it’s all said and done, Microsoft’s goal should be to make it so that gamers can boot up the system, log in and install or launch a title without ever needing to move their hands away from the joysticks and face buttons. That means no shifting your fingers to tap a prompt on its touchscreen or needing to pull up a virtual keyboard/touchpad. And no add-on apps like ASUS’ Armoury Crate or Lenovo’s Legion Space, either. Those are simply Band-Aids that cover up the core issue of Windows 11 not being properly optimized for portable gaming PCs. If the company can do that, everything else will fall into place. Only then does it need to worry about specs and features.\nThat said, I would like to see a portable Xbox include an OLED display with support for variable refresh rates that go up to either 120Hz or 144Hz. A microSD card slot is also a must, as it has become a standard component across gaming handhelds (especially as the size of AAA games continues to balloon). I’d also like to see Hall Effect sensors powering its joysticks (and triggers) for increased responsiveness and durability. A dock for connecting it to a TV or monitor would be a nice accessory too. And while it’s not an absolute necessity, I think some sort of built-in touchpad (or two, like on the Steam Deck), would go a long way toward making traditional mouse-and-keyboard games much more enjoyable on a handheld device.\nHonestly, the case for an Xbox handheld seems so obvious it’s kind of surprising Microsoft didn’t announce one years ago. Granted, it’s possible that the company has been waiting for the next version of its OS (i.e. Windows 12) to make a major concerted push on both traditional PCs and handhelds. But every month that goes by without a true first-party streamlined portable Xbox gaming machine feels like a wasted opportunity.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/its-about-damn-time-microsoft-made-an-xbox-gaming-handheld-130046591.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Roku testing auto-play video ads before loading the home screen",
    "url": "c065a052-ecab-4a33-a96e-a47157178d30",
    "content": "Roku has begun running video ads that automatically play before loading the home screen, as reported by Ars Technica. This is impacting owners of Roku-branded smart TVs and streaming sticks, so long as the device runs the company’s proprietary OS. It’s worth noting that Roku users already see commercials on the home screen itself, so folks have to suffer through an ad to get to the ads.\nMultiple users have reported seeing commercials for the movie Moana 2, though there does seem to be an option to close the video. A Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirmed the new ad placement but said it's just a test. The company declined to comment on whether or not this would become a permanent fixture within the OS.\nOur business “has and will always require continuous testing and innovation across design, navigation, content, and our first-rate advertising products,” the statement read. “Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a delightful and simple user experience.”\nRoku is trying pushing how far to enshittify by introducing ad autoplay before the home screen. \"I just turned on my Roku and got an unskippable ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.\"Speak up before experiment turns into reality. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/NUkmHoemts— Techlore (@TechloreInc) March 18, 2025\n\nAs expected, Roku users aren’t exactly pumped about this new ad-delivery method. Some have suggested that they would get rid of their devices if the company keeps the test going. Many consumers have expressed that they are fine with the static ads seen on the home screen, but that a loud video is simply a bridge too far.\nAs a whole, Smart TVs have become a serious growth market for advertisements. These TVs are high-tech and, as such, they track our viewing habits at nearly every turn. Some companies actually lose money on the hardware and make most of their profits via our eyeballs. Roku, as an example, lost $44 million on its physical devices in 2023, but made nearly $1.6 billion with its ads and services products.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/roku-testing-auto-play-video-ads-before-loading-the-home-screen-171517685.html?src=rss",

    "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/yonaguni-japan-island-china-taiwan-war-photos-2025-3",
    "content": "A Japanese flag waves inside the fence of the Japan Self-Defense Forces base on Yonaguni.Ayaka McGill/APA remote Japanese island inadvertently found itself in the crosshairs of China-Taiwan tensions.Less than 100 miles from Taiwan's capital, Japan's westernmost island has rapidly militarized.China's looming threat has left the island's tiny population of 1,500 concerned for their safety.A quiet Japanese island has found itself on the front lines of the tense dispute over Taiwan.Growing tensions between China and Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims is part of its territory, has transformed Japan's once quaint ecotourism destination into a military fortress.Yonaguni, Japan's westernmost island, is located just shy of 100 miles from the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, making it a strategic frontline outpost for Japan and allies like the US. In a reminder of the island's new status, a cattle ranch has become a military base, and authorities are expanding the port to accommodate larger warships.\"As a child, I was so proud of this westernmost border island,\" Fumie Kano, an innkeeper on Yonaguni, told the Associated Press. \"But recently, we are repeatedly told this place is dangerous, and I feel so sad.\"While the influx of troops has boosted the island's security and economy, residents are forced to brace themselves against a possible conflict mere miles away.Japan's westernmost islandA monument marks Japan's westernmost point on Yonaguni.Ayaka McGill/APLocated over 300 miles from Okinawa's main island, Yonaguni Island is considered the most remote of all the Okinawan islands. The island has an area of about 11 square miles — roughly the same size as Disney World's Magic Kingdom theme park.Only a third of the island is inhabited by three villages — Sonai, Kubura, and Higawa — with the remaining area being covered by farmland and vegetation.Fishing, agriculture, and tourism are the main sources of livelihood for the island's tiny population of about 1,500 people.The island was once home to 12,000 people in the late 1940s, but has shrunk to less than 2,000 people in recent years.Known for natural beauty — and Bad BunnyWild horses graze on the vegetation on Yonaguni island.Ayaka McGill/APYonaguni is known for its picturesque landscapes and rare animal species, including three-foot-tall ponies that can only be found on the island. The Atlas moth, considered the world's largest moth with a wingspan of nearly 10 inches, is also native to the island.As Japan's westernmost inhabited island, it is the last place in Japan to see the setting sun.In 2021, the island also inspired Bad Bunny's chart-topping reggaeton song, Yonaguni, in which the Puerto Rican rapper sings in both Spanish and Japanese.Home to Japan's so-called 'Atlantis'A diver swims by an underwater section of the Yonaguni Monument known as the Main Terrace.Melkov/Wikimedia CommonsThe island is also known for mysterious underwater ruins stretching over 300 feet near its southern coast, known as the Yonaguni Monument. Whether the monument was manmade or naturally formed is still under debate, with scientists estimating that the megalith could have been created long before humans had the means to create such a structure.Divers have spotted hammerhead sharks and, on rare occasions, a whale shark, the largest fish in the world.Arming the islandAn infographic shows the ballistic missile launch points and flight paths fired by China in August 2022.CSIS/ChinaPowerYonaguni lies less than 70 miles from the east coast of Taiwan between the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea.As China's military presence continues to grow in the region, Japan has strengthened its military presence, particularly on its southwestern islands, such as Ishigaki, Miyako, and Yonaguni.A cattle ranch on Yonaguni has been transformed into a military base, and Japanese forces plan to expand an airport and port on the island's south coast to accommodate large ships.The Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force has deployed US-made PAC-3 interceptor missile units and Japanese surface-to-air missile systems to the southwestern islands.Tom Shugart, former US Navy submariner and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the missile systems could be useful in a conflict scenario over Taiwan.\"If Japan is involved in helping to defend Taiwan, which it has said it might, then that system might be useful,\" Shugart told Newsweek. \"Not so much for protecting any large-scale infrastructure on Yonaguni — because I don't think there is any — but it might be useful for protecting offensive systems that could be used against China.\"Idyllic island to fortified fortressAn aerial view of the fishing port at Kubura village on Yonaguni.Ayaka McGill/APDespite residents voting to bring Japanese military forces and assets to the island, some locals remain apprehensive about the rapid militarization of the island.\"Even those who voted in favour of the base are scared about missiles being based here,\" Toshio Sakimoto, a local councillor, told The Guardian. \"I worry whenever something is happening in Taiwan, such as an election or Chinese military drills.\"To quell islanders' fears about what would happen in an actual emergency, officials released a plan last detailing the evacuation of 120,000 residents on remote islands in just under a week.Yonaguni Mayor Kenichi Itokazu proposed building a basement shelter and expanding its port to support evacuation efforts by sea, though skepticism still surrounds the contingency efforts.\"It's absurd,\" Kano, the Yonaguni innkeeper, told AP of the evacuation plan. \"I just hope the money will be spent on policies that will help the people in Yonaguni live peacefully.\"A growing military presenceThe entrance to the Japan Self-Defense Forces base on Yonaguni island.Ayaka McGill/APNot only has the landscape of Yonaguni changed in recent years, but the population is also experiencing a shift.Following a 2015 referendum, hundreds of Japanese troops have been deployed to Yonaguni, including a coast watch unit and an electronic warfare unit.The local economy has improved and, in turn, grown largely dependent on Japanese military personnel and their families which now make up a fifth of the island's population, sparking concerns for local civilians.\"Everything is pushed through in the name of the Taiwan emergency,\" Kyoko Yamaguchi, a local potter, told the AP, \"and many feel this is too much.\"Public data forecasts that the troop population and their dependents could make up over 31% of the island's tiny 1,500-member population, The Guardian reported, with the potential to rise to almost 40% the following year.Tetsu Inomata, a café owner who lived in Yonaguni for 20 years, told The Guardian that he believes the Japanese armed forces could overtake the island's civilian population in the next few years.Disrupting the peaceA fishing boat sails along the coast of Yonaguni.Ayaka McGill/APResidents of the island have seen firsthand China's increasing military presence in the region.In 2022, China fired several ballistic missiles into Japan's southwestern waters, one of which landed just 50 miles from Yonaguni island near 20 fishing boats, though no injuries or damage was reported in the incident.\"It was an extremely dangerous exercise that really made us feel China's potential threat right next to us,\" Shigenori Takenishi, chief of Yonaguni's fisheries association, told the AP.In August, the US Marine Corps deployed radar to Camp Yonaguni after Chinese Y-9 electronic intelligence aircraft and two drones presumed to belong to China passed near the island during surveillance missions of Taiwan.The next month, Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning transited through waters between Yonaguni and Iriomote Islands, which drew concern from the West. The percentage of Chinese warships passing through the Yonaguni Channel has increased since 2020 from 0 to over 26% as of 2024, according to Japan's defense ministry.The US and Japan have also conducted military drills in the region, in part to project power against China. Stressed by ongoing military activity, locals criticized the drills as disrupting the island's serenity.A divided communityShigenori Takenishi, the head of the fisheries cooperative on Yunaguni, gestures toward a hanging swordfish.Ayaka McGill/APThe militarization of the once-tranquil island has left residents divided on whether the buildup has been beneficial or detrimental.Supporters say Japanese military personnel have been crucial for the island's safety and a much-needed boost to its struggling local economy. Prior to hosting Japanese troops, Yonaguni officials had planned to form economic relations through commercial exchanges with Taiwan via direct ferries between the islands.Critics have accused the US and Japan of exploiting the island simply for the sake of military posturing against China, with little to no regard for its impact on its residents and the environment.\"I think the plan has been to have long-range missiles here that are capable of reaching the coast of China,\" Inomata, the café owner, told The Guardian. \"We're being used by the Americans, and Japanese leaders like Fumio Kishida and Shinzō Abe have been willing participants. For them, everything is about defense.\"'Beautiful island turning into a battlefield'A local innkeeper stands outside her business on Yonaguni.Ayaka McGill/APShoko Komine, a local restaurant owner, told The Guardian that there's a chance Yonaguni could get \"dragged into\" a conflict over Taiwan, which would drive people away from visiting the island.\"I don't think there is going to be a conflict any time soon, but even the risk of something happening will stop tourists from coming,\" Komine said. \"The town government should put more effort into promoting tourism, but at the moment it is obsessed with defense.\"Yonaguni residents fear the military build-up could tarnish the island's reputation as a peaceful island known for its untamed wildlife and beauty.\"Being at the center of this issue is very stressful for residents,\" local shopkeeper Takako Ueno told the AP. \"I don't want people to imagine this beautiful island turning into a battlefield.\"Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "content": "The iPhone 17 Air (even the name is a rumor) is reportedly arriving this fall. As that Air suffix suggests, it could be Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever.\nHowever, while thin is all good, an arguably more intriguing change didn’t quite make it through the design process. In the latest Power On newsletter (we love a newsletter), Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said Apple had planned to ditch the USB-C port, making “Apple’s first completely port-free iPhone.” The notion was ditched in the face of more EU regulator issues, but it could appear in subsequent iPhones.\nDon’t worry, though, Apple has plenty of incoming phones to distract you. We’re expecting Apple to release another four iPhones this year, with the one currently nicknamed the iPhone 17 Air roughly 2 millimeters thinner than the rest. It could replace the Plus iPhone, with the family running from an entry-level iPhone 17 through to two higher-end Pro models. The new iPhone Air would nestle somewhere in the middle, for around $900.\nRumors about the iPhone Air’s specs are still coalescing and shifting, but many reports suggest a single-camera system, the Dynamic Island and the Camera Control button.\nAlas, no iPhone mini.

    "title": "The wildest details in the Facebook memoir Meta is trying to bury",
    "url": "5041d3e6-3a13-458e-965e-9e5da5b5efa1",
    "content": "Sarah Wynn-Williams joined Facebook in 2011 when it was very much in its “move fast and break things” era. A former United Nations diplomat, she had aspirations of helping Facebook boost its standing on the global stage.\nOver nearly seven years at the company, she had a front-row seat to some of Facebook’s most consequential (and controversial) moments. Last week, she published Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, a memoir about her time at the company and how she slowly became disillusioned about Facebook’s role in the world.\nSince it was announced, Meta has thrown the full weight of its PR machine against the book. The company initiated arbitration proceedings, which resulted in a ruling that now prevents Wynn-Williams from promoting her own book. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the arbitrator’s decision “affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published.” He said that “urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years.”\nHer publisher, Flatiron Books, said in a statement it was “appalled” by Meta’s actions, noting that “the arbitrator's order makes no reference to the claims” in the book, which “went through a thorough editing and vetting process.”\nAfter reading the book, it’s easy to see why Meta PR has made such a fuss. Wynn-Williams worked closely with the company’s top executives, traveling around the world with Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg as they met with foreign leaders and shaped the policies that would define Facebook. She also delivers many firsthand accounts of what Zuckerberg, Sandberg and current Chief of Global Affairs Joel Kaplan did and said behind closed doors. Much of it isn’t pretty.\nHere are some of her most shocking claims:\nZuckerberg requested to be “gently mobbed” during a visit to Asia\nWynn-Williams was often tasked with organizing the meetings various Facebook executives took with heads of state and other government officials. One of the more bizarre details is Zuckerberg’s request ahead of a three-week long trip to Asia. According to Wynn-Williams, Zuckerberg requested that she arrange either a “peace rally” or a “riot” during his visit. Facebook’s CEO never explains the request, but Wynn-Williams speculates he wanted \"to test out how effective his product is in turning Facebook’s online tools into offline power.”\nAt first, I think he's joking. Peace rallies are not my area of expertise, and-to be frank-I've never been asked to organize a riot before. Especially one for a tech CEO. I assume something has been lost in his communication-that it's some sort of mix-up. \"Riot\" and \"peace rally\" are such completely different things. Then Debbie emails to say that she ran into Mark and he told her that he wants a peace rally or a riot and we need to come up with some ideas that will enable him to be surrounded by people or be \"gently mobbed.\"\nZuckerberg refused to take meetings before noon, even with heads of state\nZuckerberg apparently had a “strict” policy about not taking any meetings before noon. This policy applied not only to internal meetings with others at Facebook, but heads of state. Wynn-Williams recounts how Zuckerberg’s “refusal” to take morning meetings almost derailed a planned meeting with the president of Colombia. That same year, she said she was forced to reschedule Zuckerberg’s address at the UN to a later time slot because, according to Wynn-Williams, “the United Nations isn’t important enough for Mark to do an event before noon.”\nMeta built Zuckerberg a special room to protect him from Zika\nFacebook took “extreme measures” to protect Zuckerberg from Zika during a visit to Peru for the APEC conference. To protect the CEO, who was apparently hoping to soon conceive his second child, the company opted \"to build a ‘controlled structure’ on the site of the APEC conference center where ventilation, exposure to others, and bug mitigation can be overseen by Facebook.” Wynn-Williams dubbed it “operation perfect sperm.”\nZuckerberg’s “desperate” attempts to talk to Xi Jinping\nWynn-Williams spends a lot of time delving into Facebook’s plans to bring the social network to China. She also details Zuckerberg’s attempts to get face time with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nIn 2015, Zuckerberg flew to Seattle for a “longer than normal” handshake with Xi (who was in the city for a tech summit Zuckerberg was not invited to). He later caused a “diplomatic crisis” when he posted a photo of that handshake, which only shows the back of Xi’s head.\nThe following year, Zuckerberg and his team hoped to surreptitiously get the CEO in front of Xi at APEC in Peru. Facebook arranged for Zuckerberg to give a speech directly before an appearance by Xi, which meant the two men would be in adjacent dressing rooms. The goal, according to Wynn-Williams, was to engineer a “spontaneous encounter” during which Zuckerberg could make his pitch to get Facebook into China.\nBut when Xi arrived, he was flanked by “dozens and dozens” of men in military uniforms who created a barrier such that, according to Wynn-Williams, Xi didn't even have to “risk making eye contact with Mark.” She says that Zuckerberg was “hurt” by the demonstration.\nSheryl Sandberg wanted Facebook to promote organ donation\nNot long after starting at Facebook, Wynn-Williams says she was told that “Facebook’s first proactive initiative to build relationships with governments around the world will be organ donation.” The idea was apparently Sandberg’s, who ran into a former Harvard friend and transplant surgeon and “offered to help him source donors.”\nBut when Wynn-Williams brought up the logistical and legal issues that generally make it difficult to transport organs between countries, she says Sandberg was “indignant.”\n“Do you mean to tell me that if my four-year-old was dying and the only thing that would save her was a new kidney, that I couldn’t fly to Mexico and get one and put it in my handbag?”\nFacebook would later add organ donation to the “life events” users could add to their profiles.\nSheryl Sandberg and the plane crash that wasn't\nIn 2013, an Asiana flight from Seoul to San Francisco crash-landed on a runway, killing two people and injuring more than 100 passengers. Sandberg, who was promoting her book Lean In at the time, was also traveling from Seoul to San Francisco that day. Following the crash, she posted on Facebook that she and several Facebook colleagues were originally meant to be on that flight but had “switched to United so we could use miles for my family's tickets.”\nSandberg’s supposed near-miss generated multiple headlines, which isn’t surprising, as Wynn-Williams claims Sandberg was personally briefing reporters about the incident. Wynn-Williams was baffled by these reports. She writes that the Facebook COO “always flies United” and “never considered Asiana.” In her recollection, she and another colleague remarked to each other how “weird” it was for Sandberg to do this.\nWhy Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s Facebook posts get so much engagement\nWynn-Williams heavily implies that there may be some behind-the-scenes manipulation of Zuckerberg and Sandberg’s Facebook posts. She doesn’t offer any proof that this has happened, but says that a meeting attended by “someone from Mark’s personal communications team” raises the possibility.\nAccording to Wynn-Williams, “Sheryl’s assistant describes his job as managing ‘engagement for Mark and Sheryl's social media using all of Facebook's tools.’” When Wynn-Williams asks directly if they are “gaming” the site’s algorithm, she says the assistant replies that “you don’t want to know.”\nJoel Kaplan needed a geography lesson\nSome of the most telling anecdotes in Careless People involve Kaplan, who joined Facebook’s policy team in 2011 and was promoted to Chief Global Affairs Officer earlier this year. She writes that Kaplan, who was a deputy chief of staff in the George W. Bush White House, was “surprised to learn Taiwan is an island” and that “often when we start to talk about pressing issues in some country in Latin America or Asia, he stops and asks me to explain where the country is.”\nKaplan slow-rolled Facebook’s response to problems in Myanmar\nBy now, Meta’s failures in Myanmar, where hate speech and misinformation on Facebook helped incite a genocide, are well documented. Wynn-Williams, who early in her tenure flew to Myanmar to try to sell officials there on the company’s connectivity projects, describes her futile attempts to get more resources for content moderation in the country.\nShe blames Kaplan in particular. She says she “started this long process of trying to hire someone for Myanmar in 2015” and found a human rights expert who fit the bill in May 2016, but Kaplan blocked her from making the hire in February of 2017. He allegedly told her to “move on and get over it.” She later concludes that “when it came to Myanmar, those people just didn’t matter to him.”\n(Meta had broadly labeled Wynn-Williams’ claims about Facebook’s actions in Myanmar as “old news,” saying in a statement that “the facts here have been public record since 2018, and we have said publicly we know we were too slow to act on abuse on our services in Myanmar.”)\nKaplan’s alleged harassment\nWynn-Williams also accuses Kaplan of harassment and other inappropriate behavior. After complications while giving birth left her in a literal coma, she writes that Kaplan asked her over one of their “regular” calls during her maternity leave “where are you bleeding from” and got angry when she didn't answer. Later, when she returned to work, he gave her an unofficial performance review on her first day back, saying that she wasn’t “responsive enough.”\nWynn-Williams eventually reports Kaplan’s behavior and an investigation is opened, but that “very quickly it seems to switch from an investigation of Joel, or the facts, to an investigation of me.” She’s fired at her next performance review.\nMeta has disputed Wynn-Williams' allegations. “This book is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.\"\nUpdate, March 18, 2025, 1:57 PM PT: Wynn-Williams describes her tenure at Facebook as lasting seven years, beginning in 2011. But, according to a Meta spokesperson, she was fired in \"late 2017.\" This story has been updated to reflect that she worked at Facebook for \"nearly\" seven years.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-wildest-details-in-the-facebook-memoir-meta-is-trying-to-bury-183310491.html?src=rss",

    "content": "BYD has introduced new technology for charging electric vehicles at vastly quicker speeds. Founder Wang Chuanfu said this \"super e-platform\" tech offers a peak charging speed of 1,000 kilowatts, twice that of the 500 kw charging currently offered by Tesla's superchargers. That would mean a car can travel 249 miles (400 kilometers) from a five-minute charge on a BYD station. This charging architecture will initially be available in two of BYD's vehicle models: the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV.\n\"In order to completely solve our user's charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,\" said Wang.\nThe company is also bringing its quick-charging tech to Chinese drivers for the first time. BYD plans to construct 4,000 ultra-fast charging units across the country, although it did not provide a timeline or budget for the endeavor. To date, owners of BYD vehicles have needed to use charging stations from third-party operators or different EV manufacturers such as Tesla.\nBYD has been putting more and more EVs on the road around the world. Last year, its second-quarter shipment figures jumped 21 percent to draw very close to Tesla's numbers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/byd-unveils-new-tech-for-twice-as-fast-ev-charging-175729412.html?src=rss",

    "content": "Microsoft just announced that its Xbox Adaptive Joystick is now available for purchase directly from the company. This news comes during the annual Ability Summit. The Adaptive Joystick is designed for people with limited mobility, so it has four customizable button inputs on the front and two more mappable bumper and trigger-style buttons. It also comes with a standard thumbstick. It costs $30, which is cheaper than the official wireless Xbox controller. \n\n That’s just one accessibility-minded announcement that Microsoft made today. The company is bringing AI tools to the screen-reader Narrator for Windows. This will allow the software to offer “rich image descriptions.” It’ll be available to Windows Insider members sometime this spring. \nMicrosoft Teams is also getting an update for those who are hard of hearing. The software will soon be able to automatically recognize when someone is using sign language, placing them prominently as a speaker during the meeting. This is what Sign Language View already does, but it’s an opt-in service. The update streamlines the process. It’ll be available later this year. The company has long been at the forefront of accessibility-related tech. It made a nifty Adaptive Mouse that allows for near-endless customization options. Microsoft also created technology that pairs game controllers without forcing users to touch the console and a kit to make Surface laptops more accessible. The brand first introduced the original Adaptive Controller around six years ago.  \n This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-xbox-adaptive-joystick-is-now-available-183009651.html?src=rss",

    "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/making-new-adult-friends-is-hard-app-helped-meet-people-2025-3",
    "content": "I joined an app to meet and connect with others in my community. My whole family (not pictured) ended up making genuine friends.gorodenkoff/Getty ImagesMaking new friends as an adult is hard.The Peanut app connects women based on interests, location, and children's ages for meetups.Using the app helped me make new friends and expand my whole family's social circle.After college, it was difficult to make new friends after many of us parted ways for our hometowns, further education, or job opportunities. Even in graduate school, people had their own jobs and social circles and it became more challenging to connect with others. Using a friendship app for women completely changed that for me.I wanted to find connections with people like meI had read about the Peanut app in a magazine when my son was an infant. I liked the idea of connecting with other women in the same situation as me and eagerly started using the app for meetups once my son was old enough to run around and play. Since Peanut is geared towards women, it works well both for arranging playdates and making friends for myself. The app is set up similarly to online dating, users create a profile, check some boxes with your interests like \"bookworm\" or \"gamer girl,\" list your kids' ages, and then swipe through profile matches. The app allows users to customize the experience, by showing potential connections based on location and child's age, as well as interests or work life. Once I completed the initial signup, I heard back from my first connections within 1 to 2 days. I chatted back and forth with a few of them for several weeks before suggesting a meetup.The first mom I agreed to meet up with invited another Peanut connection on the same zoo outing. All three of us had sons who were around the same age. While at the zoo, the other boys were hopping in and out of their strollers to look at animals while my slightly younger son struggled getting back into the stroller after every stop. It was difficult for me because I was also wearing my 4-month old in a carrier. My son was also much more intrigued by their snacks than his own. I called it quits early, expecting not to hear back from the other moms. To my surprise, one suggested a second meetup and now our families get together a few times a month.I appreciate that the app is intentionalOther women come to the Peanut app with the same intent — to create friendships, either digitally or in person. While not everyone winds up reciprocating and responding to messages, the likelihood of making friends has seemed decent in my experience.Seeing someone once a week in-person through an organization or in-person mom group might eventually lead to a friendship, but it takes more time and some guts to reach out. Making mom friends \"in the wild,\" to quote a friend of mine, can feel more awkward, and risky in the sense that you could be turned down. By contrast, the moms that I connected with in the app take turns with me in initiating our meetups, and I greatly appreciate that intention in our friendships.The app helps you make the first stepThe Peanut app help me with the initial effort of reaching out by providing ice breakers for messages. Prompts like \"pineapple on pizza, yes or no?\" or \"describe yourself using 3 emojis\" can help get the conversation flowing. Of course, many initial messages still get ignored and some people only ever message, \"Hi!\" or can't carry a conversation. There were a couple of moms I only met up with once or twice and we never messaged again. It's not a perfect system, but I did make some genuine connections that I'm grateful for.It has broadened my whole family's social circleThe friend from my first Peanut meetup invited me to join her book club, which is composed of Peanut moms and her neighbors and coworkers. The group has been going strong for more than 2 years. We read quite a variety of books of all genres, and are ladies of all ages with a variety of jobs. Without the app, I would have never connected with this wonderful group.One of the husbands — a bit jealous that he didn't have a similar group — started organizing some men's events. My husband now gets invited to trivia nights that he enjoys.Now my social life is the most vibrant it has been since college. Using the app has created a broad range of friends for my family, which is amazing, especially when you meet the unicorn mom who has a whole family that gets along well with your family, which I have.Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Democratic FTC commissioners say they were just ‘illegally fired’ by President Trump",
    "url": "https://www.theverge.com/?p=632267",
    "content": "\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired the two remaining Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission Tuesday in what appears to be a conspicuous exercise of power over the independent agency.\nThe White House confirmed the dismissals in an unsigned email response to The Verge. Democratic Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya shared his dismissal in a Notes app message posted to his X account Tuesday evening. “The president just illegally fired me,” Bedoya writes. “This is corruption plain and simple.” Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter also called the firing illegal in a statement saying it violates “the plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent.”\nBoth commissioners suggest in their statements that the firings are a nod to corporate power. “The administration clearly fears the accountability that opposition voices would provide if the President orders Chairman Ferguson to treat the most powerful corporations and their executives — like those that flanked the President at his inauguration — with kid gloves,” Slaughter writes. Bedoya says Trump “wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies,” rather than take on consumer protection and competition issues in big businesses. Earlier on Tuesday, Wired reported that the FTC had removed business guidance blogs from the past four years that included an information page explaining how AI chatbots can be designed in compliance with FTC regulations on unfair and deceptive practices, as well as information about the agency’s privacy lawsuits against Amazon and Microsoft that were brought against the companies under Khan. \nTrump “wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies”\nPrior to joining the FTC, Bedoya was perhaps best known for his research on algorithmic bias, as well how surveillance affects Black communities. Slaughter is also known for her work on algorithmic discrimination against protected classes. While serving as commissioner, Slaughter tweeted in 2020 about how the FTC can be “antiracist.” In a following interview she said that “antitrust law is clearly about economic structure, and economic structure in this country has a pretty profoundly racialized effect.”\nIt’s typical during a change in administration for the prior administration’s FTC chair to submit a resignation, since the president has the power to tap a leader of the agency, as Trump did when promoting Republican Andrew Ferguson from commissioner to chair. It’s also common for the other commissioners to remain for the duration of their terms, since under the law, no more than three commissioners at the agency can be from a single party. As was to be expected, former Democratic Chair Lina Khan stepped down from her post at the agency earlier this year. Trump appointed Republican Andrew Ferguson to lead the agency and has also nominated Mark Meador to round out the agency’s Republicans alongside Melissa Holyoak. With a Republican majority, the FTC would already be able to push forward policies and enforcement actions without Democratic support. \nAgain, that is the normal state of affairs when the White House changes hands. But the firings of these existing Democratic commissioners is highly unusual. However, close watchers of this White House might have expected this legally-fraught break with longstanding norms, not just because of the administration’s bulldozer approach to so-called federal workforce reform, but also because Trump issued an executive order last month asserting “Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch,” including “so-called independent agencies” like the FTC.\n Ferguson said that as head of the executive branch, Trump “is vested with all of the executive power in our government”\nFerguson has endorsed the idea that presidents should be able to fire independent agency commissioners, saying that a 1935 Supreme Court case known as Humphrey’s Executor — which found such workers had to be dismissed for cause — “was wrongly decided.” In a statement following the dismissals, Ferguson said that as head of the executive branch, Trump “is vested with all of the executive power in our government. I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government.”\nBedoya says he will testify before the Colorado Joint House and Senate Judiciary Committees on Wednesday, “and will have more to say then.” He also adds that he plans to pursue legal action to fight his dismissal: “I’ll see the president in court.”",

    "content": "The Federal Trade Commission has removed all posts from President Joe Biden's term in office from its business blog. This online publication has historically provided advice about how companies could best comply with consumer-protection regulations, covering topics such as artificial intelligence and how big tech companies have collected and used customer data. Currently, it has no content published between December 21, 2020 and March 7, 2025.\nWired highlighted some of the notable content from the more than 300 blog posts that have been deleted. Several current and former FTC officials spoke to the publication about the change anonymously out of fear of retaliation.\n“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” one source said.\nThe FTC is being led by President Donald Trump's nominee, Andrew Ferguson. At the time of his appointment, Ferguson said he would use the department to \"end Big Tech's vendetta against competition and free speech.\" He and other Republicans have claimed that many platforms are censoring right-wing content, adding a heavy layer of irony to the FTC's latest actions.\n\"They are talking a big game on censorship,\" another source told Wired. \"But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies' bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-ftc-has-removed-all-business-blog-posts-from-the-biden-administration-214734633.html?src=rss",

    "title": "How to stream every March Madness 2025 game",
    "url": "c135b8f9-316c-4c39-8154-2851454bea68",
    "content": "The brackets are set and the teams are en route to their respective arenas. The 2025 NCAA Tournaments, affectionately known to many as March Madness, begin this week. The men’s tournament begins first on March 18 with the women’s version tipping off on March 19. Both will begin with First Four or “play-in” games (depending on who you ask) before providing action on the court through the first weekend in April. Different broadcasters own the rights to each tournament, so streaming them both can be confusing. I’ve broken down the best, most affordable way to access each one so that you'll be ready when the games begin. When does March Madness start? The men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament begins on Tuesday, March 18 with two of the so-called First Four matchups. These are the four games that are used to determine the final four teams in the main 64-team bracket. To some, they’re known as the “play-in games” although they’ve officially been part of the men's tournament since 2011. The first game on March 18 begins at 6:40PM ET with another to follow at 9:10PM ET. The same schedule is expected for the second slate of games on Wednesday, March 19. \nOn the women’s side, March Madness is offset from the men’s tournament by a day. The first two of the First Four games are Wednesday, March 19 at 7PM ET and 9PM ET. The second pair of matchups follows on Thursday, March 20 in the same two time slots. The 64-team bracket kicks off in earnest for the men at 12:15PM ET on Thursday, March 20. For the women, the main action begins at 11:30AM ET on Friday, March 21st. Here’s the full schedule for each tournament: 2025 Men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament  First Four: March 18-19 First round: March 20-21 Second round: March 22-23 Sweet 16: March 27-28 Elite Eight: March 29-30 Final Four: April 5 Championship game: April 7  2025 Women’s NCAA Basketball Tournament  First Four: March 19-20 First round: March 21-22 Second round: March 23-24 Sweet 16: March 28-29 Elite Eight: March 30-31 Final Four: April 4 Championship game: April 6  How to stream the 2025 Men’s NCAA Tournament \n\n\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery share the broadcast rights to the men’s tournament, and as they have in years past, TV coverage will be spread across four networks. During the course of March Madness, games will air on CBS, TNT, TBS and truTV, with the final rounds and championship game landing on CBS. If you already have a paid TV plan (such as traditional cable), the best way to watch the men’s tournament is with the March Madness Live app or website. Once you log in with your TV provider credentials, you can watch every game in one spot with features like multiview (up to four games at once) and “excitement alerts” that let you know when there’s a close game. The app also offers ways to follow your bracket, if you filled it out on MarchMadness.com. And when you’re watching on desktop, the crucial Boss Button will throw up a fake work screen when you need it. March Madness Live is also available on Amazon, Fire TV, Apple TV, iOS, macOS, Google Play, LG smart TVs, Roku and Xbox devices. If you don’t have a compatible TV provider already, your best option is to actually use two services. It’s not ideal, I know, but it will save you a lot of money. Max’s Standard plan is $17/month and gives you access to live games from TNT, TBS and truTV. While you can watch NCAA Tournament games with the Basic with Ads tier, B/R Sports, which powers all of the live coverage on Max, will only be available on Standard and Premium levels starting March 30. Yes, Warner Bros. Discovery set its policy to change in the middle of the tournament to make more money. For the CBS games, you’ll need a Paramount+ with Showtime subscription that costs $13/month. So, in total, your best option to stream all of the men’s tournament is $30 spread across two apps.  A live TV service like YouTube TV or Hulu plus Live TV is over $50 more per month at full price, but they would offer you “one-stop shopping” for all the games in the men’s tournament. YouTube TV is currently on sale for $70/month for the first six months you use it.  \n \n \n \n How to stream the 2025 Women’s NCAA Tournament \n\n\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n While Warner Brothers Discovery owns the rights to the men’s NCAA Tournament, ESPN has the women’s bracket locked down. Every game of the women’s tournament will be spread across ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNEWS, including the First Four matchups. The Final Four will be on ESPN, but the championship game will air on ABC. All three of those culminating games will stream on ESPN+. Since ESPN+ won’t get every game, it’s not an option if you want to watch the entire tournament. You will be able to watch “select matchups” on both ESPN+ and Disney+, but ESPN hasn’t announced what those will be. So, unfortunately, your best bet is a live-TV streaming service like Sling, YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV for a comprehensive experience. Sling is the cheapest avenue here, with the requisite Orange and Sports Extra plans costing $34 (Sling is currently offering a discount on the first month of Orange). YouTube and Hulu live TV options are both the same price at $83/month (YouTube TV currently discounted to $70 for the first six months), so it’s a matter of which set of content and features you like best. YouTube TV offers a handy multiview tool so you can watch up to four games at once, but Hulu + Live TV comes with Disney+ and ESPN+ (both with ads) for that cost. (Opting for Hulu + Live TV only saves you one whole dollar per month if you don’t include the Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu bundling.) If you’re a more casual fan who can afford to roll the dice on the “select” options on ESPN+, you can save some money. That service only costs $12/month. And if you already have a TV plan that includes the ESPN family of networks, the ESPN app is the best place to watch the tournament. The mix of scores and info, along with multiview streaming for up to four games at a time on Apple TV and Xbox, make the app a well-equipped conduit for the women’s tournament. The March Madness website only shows scores and news for the women’s tournament. There are no live games available on the website. \n \n \n \n What if I want to stream both the men’s and women’s tournaments? \n\n\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n If you’re hoping to stream all of both the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments, I hope you ordered Samsung’s eight-TV bundle. In terms of streaming services, just jump straight to a live-TV option like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV. I prefer the former because of its multiview feature – a tool that Hulu doesn’t offer. At times when there are multiple games that you want to watch, especially during the first two rounds, you’ll want multiview in order to keep tabs on all of the action. \n \n Are any of the March Madness games available to stream for free? You can watch all of the games broadcast on CBS on the March Madness website and mobile apps without a TV provider. Sure, it’s a small sample of the tournament, but it’s completely free and a good option for casual fans who don’t have a paid TV plan they can exploit for more of the action. It’s also a good option for watching the first round at work, if your company hasn’t blocked streaming sites, or if you can discreetly watch on your phone. For the women’s tournament, there aren’t any games available for free. Unless you have an old-school OTA antenna, in which case you can watch men’s games on CBS and women’s games on ABC without any kind of streaming plan. Of course, this is a streaming guide so I’d consider an antenna an extraordinary move in 2025. If you were hoping to use a free trial period to watch March Madness, I’ve got bad news. None of them will be long enough to watch an entire tournament. Some of them don’t offer them at all, but the longest is YouTube TV at 10 days which wouldn’t get you through the second weekend.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/how-to-stream-every-march-madness-2025-game-181552865.html?src=rss",

    "url": "d7544cbf-42c4-4713-9095-64af4a1ef107",
    "content": "Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky just unveiled two new smartwatches that will be instantly familiar for long-time fans of the brand. The Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2 boast always-on e-paper displays, long-lasting batteries, physical buttons and simple designs that recall the company’s heyday.\nThis is happening after Google open-sourced PebbleOS, which led Migicovsky to announce his plans to make watches for the platform he helped build. That was just six weeks ago and the units are already ready for pre-orders. He works fast, with a stated reasoning that “no one else has made a perfect smartwatch for people like us, so I’m going to make the exact smartwatch we want.”\nEric Migicovsky\nTo that end, the Core 2 Duo looks nearly identical to the iconic Pebble 2, though it has been upgraded with “modern chips and new tricks.” It features a 1.26-inch black and white e-paper display, a microphone, a lightweight polycarbonate frame and an impressive 30-day battery life. It tracks both sleep and steps, and includes a barometer and compass.\nPre-orders are open right now, with shipments going out in July. The Core 2 Duo costs $149 and is available in black and white colorways.\nEric Migicovsky\nMigicovsky calls the Core Time 2 his “dream watch” and that it’s the natural evolution from the well-reviewed Pebble Time and the unreleased Pebble Time 2. It boasts a 64-color 1.5-inch e-paper display, a metal frame and buttons, a flat glass lens for better visibility and a battery that goes for around 30 days.\nThe Core Time 2 also includes a touchscreen, heart rate monitor, microphone and speaker. It boasts IPX8 water-resistance and, of course, access to thousands upon thousands of pre-existing PebbleOS apps. Pre-orders are available now, though shipments won’t go out until December. It’s available in black or white, with a potential third color to be announced in the future, and costs $225.\nBeing as PebbleOS is open-source, both watches are fully hackable. This allows for the potential introduction of custom firmware.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-founder-eric-migicovsky-just-introduced-two-new-e-paper-smartwatches-160008363.html?src=rss",

The Lego Group and The Pokémon Company said on Tuesday that their collaboration will bear (plastic) fruit starting next year. It sounds like the ideal companion for the upcoming Lego Game Boy.\nThe companies haven't yet announced any Lego Pokémon sets — or, for that matter, anything beyond the fact that there is now a partnership and that they're targeting a 2026 release date. But the tease will likely give countless young (and old!) imaginations plenty to chew on until we know more. Children love building Legos and training Pokémon, so it's easy to imagine the collab shooting to the top of countless wishlists.\nWhile video games based on licensed Lego toy sets have been around for ages, licensed Lego sets based on video games are a newer phenomenon. Lego Minecraft has been around for over a decade, but recent years have also brought sets of Super Mario, Zelda, Overwatch and Sonic the Hedgehog in brick form.\n\"The LEGO Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand,\" Gaku Susai, Chief Product and Experience Officer at The Pokémon Company International, wrote in a press release. \"Working with the best-in-class team at the LEGO Group and seeing their dedication and passion for the project has culminated in an innovative and groundbreaking collaboration that will surprise and delight fans.

    "url": "65ddb8ab-9eff-4a4d-80ea-7c3fe39c7f14",
    "content": "Levoit's Core 400S air purifier is down to $187 from its usual $220 price, thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale. While it’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — the air purifier briefly hit $177 last year — it’s still a solid discount on one of the most convenient air purifiers for large spaces. We’ve featured Levoit in our list of the best air purifiers for its strong performance and smart features. The Core 400S can cover rooms up to 1,980 square feet using a three-stage filtration system to capture allergens, dust, pet dander and smoke. It also includes a smart sensor that adjusts fan speed based on air quality, so you’re not running it at full blast when you don’t need to. \n\n One of the Levoit Core 400S’ biggest selling points is its low noise output, which makes it a good fit for bedrooms or home offices. If you need to knuckle down and get some work done without distraction whilst keeping your room’s air clean and fresh, even at higher speeds, it stays relatively quiet compared to bulkier purifiers. It also supports smart controls via the VeSync app, allowing you to tweak settings, set schedules or monitor air quality from your phone. If you have a smart home ecosystem in place, you can connect the purifier to third-party voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant — an added layer of convenience that allows you to control the Core 400S with simple voice commands. Its 360-degree filtration system uses activated carbon to remove gases and odors, while an efficient middle filter captures 99.97 percent of pollutants as small as 0.3 microns. The built-in air quality sensor continuously monitors pollution levels, automatically adjusting performance as needed. You can track real-time air quality data on the LCD screen or through the VeSync app, which is handy (and interesting) to have access to at all times. At night, sleep mode keeps things extra quiet and subtle, dimming the display and operating at the lowest settings — or you can turn off the display completely for total darkness. If you’ve been looking for an air purifier that can handle larger spaces without taking up too much room, this deal is worth considering, saving you over $30 on its usual price thanks to the Amazon Spring Sale.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/levoits-core-400s-air-purifier-is-33-off-for-the-amazon-spring-sale-133052543.html?src=rss",

The company will roll out its new interface gradually, starting with the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 devices before making it available on its other smartphones and tablets. Samsung says the new interface was built specifically for AI and will help users interact with their devices more naturally. The new Now Bar will provide users with real-time updates on the lock screen, such as what song is playing on their earbuds, without having to unlock their phones or tablets. \nOne UI 7 comes with a number of Galaxy AI features, including AI Select that lets users interact with parts of their screen. It will allow them to copy text by drawing a circle on an element on the screen or to easily create a GIF of a video they're watching. There's Writing Assist that can automatically summarize or format text the user highlights and Drawing Assist the creates illustrations based on text prompts, rough sketches or images. Audio Eraser will make it easier to isolate sounds and remove unwanted noise from videos. \nIn addition to AI features, the One UI 7 comes with a bunch of security features, including a theft protection tool called Identity Check. It will force the user to prove their identity if their PIN gets compromised. In settings, users will also be able to block USB connections to prevent access through the USB port while the device is locked, except for battery charging. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsungs-one-ui-7-is-arriving-on-april-7-123004993.html?src=rss",

    "content": "Apple just brought its Tap to Pay technology for iPhones to a host of new European countries, including Poland, Switzerland, Finland, Hungary, Portugal and several others. This allows for contactless payments. It works with credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and a number of third-party payment platforms.\nThat last one was once a contentious issue for Apple. The company only allowed third-party developers access to its NFC technology, which powers Tap to Pay, after EU regulators threatened it with a massive antitrust fine. Apple has even agreed to allow users to make third-party wallets their default app.\nThis means that many European customers will now be able to access third-party payment platforms without jumping through any hoops. For instance, iPhone users in Finland will be able to use Tap to Pay with Stripe, SumUp, Viva and many more. Hungarians will be able to use Adyen, Global Payment, myPOS and others. It’s a veritable cornucopia of NFC payment options.\nThanks to the EU’s stiff regulations and the region’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), America has also gotten in on the act. The company recently opened up its NFC tech for third-party developers in the US and Canada. This functionality came in a software update as part of iOS 18.1.\nThis feature works in today’s announced European countries so long as the customer has an iPhone Xs or newer and that they are running a recent iOS version. Merchants don’t need any additional hardware to complete transactions. Third-party payment platforms can also integrate Tap to Pay directly into their iOS apps.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-brings-tap-to-pay-to-more-european-countries-152350220.html?src=rss",

Several states — including New York, Texas and Virginia — have banned DeepSeek from government devices. Some members of Congress and state attorneys general have pushed for legislation to prohibit the generative AI app on federal devices amid concerns over privacy and the security of government data.\nThe emergence of DeepSeek in January as a lower-cost and open-source AI model that can compete with those from the likes of OpenAI and Google saw US tech stocks take a significant hit. The DeekSeek app soared to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings at that time.\nOpenAI accused Chinese startups of cribbing from its AI models’ copybook and said that it was looking into DeepSeek, among others. The company this month claimed DeepSeek was \"state-subsidized\" and \"state-controlled,\" and called for its ban on US government, military and intelligence devices.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/commerce-department-divisions-reportedly-ban-deepseek-from-government-devices-140916241.html?src=rss",

    "title": "33 Immortals preview: A multiplayer game that feels great to play solo",
    "url": "1588afb3-fb91-4e26-94e5-5cb723ea232a",
    "content": "Playing 33 Immortals for the first time is like going to a party at a coworker’s friend’s house. The first few minutes are marked by curiosity, light suspicion and a constant hum of awkwardness, but as you mingle, the strangers become less intimidating and you start to feel like you’re a part of the flow of the night. You might even make some friends of your own. The main difference is that, with 33 Immortals, you never have to take off your fuzzy slippers.\nI’m not kidding about flow when it comes to 33 Immortals. I fell into the game’s rhythm about 15 minutes into my three-hour preview, and by the end, I was shepherding small groups of lost souls across Inferno like I worked for Satan himself. In its simplest terms, 33 Immortals is like a multiplayer Hades, though its world is based on the lore of Dante’s Divine Comedy rather than Greek myth. Its vibe is also a tad more wholesome than Hades — maybe more crowd-pleasing, which makes sense considering the focus on large-scale multiplayer maps in 33 Immortals.\n\nI played the preview solo because I was feeling particularly antisocial that day, but of course that doesn’t mean I was alone. Other players occupy the hub world and the main maps in 33 Immortals, and though I initially tried to fade into the pixels and treat it as a single-player game, I quickly found myself emoting and seeking groups of warriors to join. With so many random players on the map at any time, it’s easy to feel like your small mistakes aren’t spotted, while your successes are clear for all to see, and even participate in.\nYou start a run by picking a weapon — justice sword, sloth staff or greed daggers — and each has a special ability that only works when three players stand together and activate it. It’s different for each weapon, but the effect is consistently grand. I stuck with the Staff of Sloth, a weapon that flings purple balls of magic and whose special ability slows enemies across a large swath of the battlefield. In the heat of combat, with swarms of demons flooding the immediate area, it’s actually tricky to get three people to stand in the proper spots, but it takes just a moment of synchrony for the special ability to activate, and it’s a palpable relief every time. And then everyone immediately gets back to hurling spells, shooting arrows, flinging daggers and reviving allies, eyes peeled for the next special ability.\nTeamwork is an essential mechanic in 33 Immortals, and it’s not an intimidating one, even on an extra-introverted day. Amid all the chaos of combat, I never lost sight of my character for more than a split-second, and my dashes, interactions and attacks felt crisp and responsive. With dozens of enemies and allies on-screen at any given time, this alone is a notable achievement by developer Thunder Lotus.\nThunder Lotus\nThe game begins with a 33-player map, Inferno, which is an arid wasteland of roaming demons, 12 Torture Chambers and one big ascension battle to complete. The minions running around Inferno are easy enough to dispatch for practice and extra bones (the game’s currency), or you can run right by them without punishment. Torture Chambers are miniboss rooms designed for six players to tackle at once, but you can enter them with fewer than six, even alone. However, you’re unlikely to get far solo. The minibosses are hulking skeletons and big, flopping demon worms with plenty of health, and they always have hordes of minions as backup. Luckily, allies can join the chamber any time after a fight starts, up to six total, and no one can voluntarily leave until two swarms have been cleared. Each Torture Chamber rewards successful teams with two relic chests containing useful items and bones. One chest is always locked, requiring a key to spill its goods. You can carry up to eight relics at a time, buffing your stats in various ways, and you’re able to reroll chest items for a fairly low price.\nI had good luck defeating Torture Chambers with just three or four fighters total, but six was always welcome, hence my eventual shepherding. I also ended up prioritizing keys when shopping at the Bone Shrines scattered around Inferno because, dang it, I love unlocking chests.\nOnce all of the Torture Chambers are defeated, holy fire spreads across Inferno, pushing players into one of three ascension spots designed for 11 fighters each. Here, enemies flood the fire-ringed circle and it’s a Thunderdome situation. If you live, you get a legendary relic and ascend alongside other surviving players to Inferno’s three-headed, bat-winged boss, Lucifer. This is where 33 Immortals’ art style really shines: Lucifer is a big blue beast who feels ripped straight out of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, and there are pleasant touches of 1980s cartoons all over the game.\nThunder Lotus\nThough I battled Lucifer three times with varying team sizes, I never beat that first overworld. I’m eager to try again and unlock the next map, Purgatorio, which maxes out at 22 players.\nLike in Hades, 33 Immortals has a hub world, The Dark Woods, that players return to after each loop. This is where you’re able to apply upgrades, equip new weapons, alter your appearance and get some training in. I didn’t find any of the characters in the hub world particularly intriguing, but they serve their purpose just fine. Besides, it’s not about them — the main focus in 33 Immortals is all of the other actual people.\nAs Engadget’s UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith prophesied in June 2023, 33 Immortals only gets better with more players. 33 Immortals is available today in Early Access on Xbox Series X/S and PC (via the Xbox app and Epic Games Store). It’s also included in Game Pass.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/33-immortals-preview-a-multiplayer-game-that-feels-great-to-play-solo-130029157.html?src=rss",

    "content": "HyperX just introduced a new wireless headset that can keep rocking for up to 200 hours on a single charge. That’s over a week of constant music. The Cloud III S is a followup to 2023’s original wireless headset, but brings Bluetooth audio into the mix. The robust battery allows for the aforementioned 200 hours of listening when using Bluetooth.\nThat metric drops to around 120 hours when streaming audio via a 2.4GHz wireless connection. Just like the original, the headphones ship with a USB dongle for 2.4GHz. However, it can connect without a dongle when using certain newer HP Omen gaming laptops.\nHyperX \nA long-lasting battery isn’t the only innovation the Cloud III S brings to the table. It’s also fully customizable, via magnetic ear plates. These are 3D-printed on demand, which is something HyperX has been experimenting with for a while. Users can create and buy these customized 3D-printed ear plates directly from HyperX, but only in select countries.\nThere’s also a removable boom mic for traveling, but that won’t impede the ability to take calls or trash talk other gamers. The headphones feature a backup omni-directional mic, which is a nice touch.\nThe HyperX Cloud III S is expected to hit store shelves in May, but pricing hasn’t been solidified yet. For reference, the original Cloud III launched for $170. The new headset will be available in an all-back or black and red.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyperxs-new-cloud-iii-s-wireless-headset-streams-bluetooth-audio-for-200-hours-on-a-single-charge-184838572.html?src=rss",

    "url": "937345ca-b061-46e7-8e7e-e9410f1b266d",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's efforts to remake the US government continued today with the firing of the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. This agency has historically had five members: three from the same party as the president and two from the opposing party. The New York Times reported that the president terminated the roles for FTC Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. \nBoth Slaughter and Bedoya said today that firing them is illegal. Commissioners' terms can only be ended early for good cause, such as \"inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\" Also, no more than three commissioners can come from the same political party, meaning the pair also cannot be replaced by additional Republicans. It seems likely that Trump will face a legal challenge over the attempt to eliminate these positions.\n\"The law protects the independence of the Commission because the law serves the American people, not corporate power,\" Slaughter said in a statement. \"The reason that the FTC can be so effective for the American people is because of its independence and because its commissioners serve across political parties and ideologies. Removing opposition voices may not change what the Trump majority can do, but it does change whether they will have accountability when they do it.\"\nBedoya also posted about the action on X, seconding Slaughter's statement that removing their posts is illegal. \"Tomorrow I will testify before the Colorado Joint House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and will have more to say then,\" he wrote.\nTrump signed an executive order in February attempting to exert more control over several agencies that were formed to intentionally remain outside the White House's purview. The order targeted agencies such as the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FTC recently deleted all the posts on its business blog from President Biden's administration, leaving a four-year gap with no published compliance advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/president-trump-has-fired-the-ftcs-two-democrat-commissioners-225952614.html?src=rss",

    "content": "NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 has returned to Earth safely after a stay of more than nine months aboard the International Space Station. The crew remained in space longer than expected due to issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule, which was originally scheduled to bring them home sooner.\nWhile the mission has been politically fraught, the astronauts said in a rare space-to-earth interview last month that they were neither stranded nor abandoned. \"That's been the rhetoric. That's been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck -- and I get it. We both get it,\" [NASA astronaut Butch] Wilmore said. \"But that is, again, not what our human spaceflight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.\" Wilmore added a request: \"If you'll help us change the rhetoric, help us change the narrative. Let's change it to 'prepared and committed.' That's what we prefer...\" CNN has more details on the arrival: Williams and Wilmore, alongside NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Russia's Roscosmos space agency, safely splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida at 5:57 p.m. ET. The crew's highly anticipated return came after the crew climbed aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule and departed the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. ET. Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov spent Tuesday morning and afternoon in orbit in the roughly 13-foot-wide (4-meter-wide), gumdrop-shaped SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Gradually descending, the capsule carried the astronauts from the space station, which orbits about 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, toward the thick inner layer of our planet's atmosphere.\nAround 5 p.m. ET, the Crew Dragon capsule began firing its engines to begin the final phase of the journey: reentry. This leg of the journey is considered the most dangerous of any flight home from space. The jarring physics of hitting the atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound routinely heats the exterior of returning spacecraft to more than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,926 degrees Celsius) and can trigger a communication blackout. After plunging toward home, the Crew Dragon spacecraft deployed two sets of parachutes in quick succession to further slow its descent. The capsule decelerated from orbital speeds of more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour) to less than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) as the vehicle hit the ocean.\nAfter the vehicle hit the ocean, a SpaceX rescue ship waiting nearby worked to haul the spacecraft out of the water. Williams and Wilmore and their crewmates will soon exit Dragon and take their first breaths of earthly air in nine months. Medical teams will evaluate the crew's health, as is routine after astronauts return from space, before deciding next steps. Ultimately, the NASA crew members will return to their home base at Johnson Space Center in Houston. You can watch a recording of the re-entry and splashdown here.\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "content": "Since the start of March, Google has been aggressively expanding the availability of AI Overviews, dropping the requirement that you need to be logged into your Google account to access the feature. Now the company is bringing yet another AI tool to Search. The next time you go online to find medical information on your phone, you may see a new \"What People Suggest\" panel at the top of Google.\nUsing AI, the feature will organize \"different perspectives from online discussions into easy-to-understand themes,\" explains Google. For instance, say you or one of your family members suffers from arthritis, the panel will curate \"real insights from people who also have the condition,\" with links so you can dig deeper. The feature is currently only available on mobile devices in the US.\nGoogle doesn't say how it plans to prevent the panel from surfacing misinformation. Instead, it mentions that it has worked to improve AI Overviews related to health topics so they \"continue to meet a high bar for clinical factuality.\" However, even after Google implemented additional safeguards to prevent AI Overviews from generating inaccurate summaries, and began using Gemini 2.0 to tackle more complicated questions, the feature can still return bizarre answers. For instance, an AI Overview recently told my colleague Kris Holt that the first day Canadians can start contributing toward their RRSP for 2026 starts on March 61.\nAt the same event where Google debuted the What People Suggest panel, the company had other health-related announcements. The search giant said it was releasing a series of new Medical Records APIs through its Health Connect platform. With the update, Google says it will be easier to connect your health data with data from your doctor's office. Google also provided an update on the Pixel Watch 3's loss of pulse detection feature. After announcing it was coming soon with the latest Pixel feature drop, Google now says it will roll out at end of the month.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-using-ai-to-display-crowdsourced-medical-information-144525853.html?src=rss",

    "content": "InteraXon, the makers of the Muse wearable EEG, believe it’s made a big leap in scanning your brain’s health. It is launching the Muse S Athena, it’s fourth-generation device which adds a Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor. fNIRS is designed to track how much oxygen is in your brain, the levels of which vary depending on its activity. The company claims the sensor offers you the equivalent of a VO2 Max reading, but for your brain, aiding you on your journey to become mentally swole.\nIf you’re unfamiliar, Muse has produced three wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices over the last decade. Put it on your forehead, close your eyes and, for instance, you’ll get audio feedback depending on what brainwaves your mind is pumping out. It’s useful for people who are learning meditation, since you’ll get the sound of birds chirping when your mental state is relaxed. The app offers targeted programs to help improve your relaxation, combat stress, improve focus and even keep an eye on how well you’re sleeping.\nDaniel Cooper for Engadget\nThe Muse S Athena uses the same hardware-and-headband combination from the Muse S, which lets you wear it to sleep. Naturally, the biggest advancement here is the fNIRS sensor, paired with both the EEG and the company’s AI-driven foundational brain model. With it, you’ll get feedback on how much oxygen is flowing to your brain — a metric of how much mental effort you’re making at any given time. During meditation and relaxation exercises, you want that figure quite low, and when you’re trying to build up your focus and concentration, you want it to climb northward.\nNaturally, when worn to bed, you’ll get a record of your sleep stages, including how deep your sleep is. The company also promises that, if you use their audio cues to trigger sleep, you’ll also be able to use them to drift back to sleep if you wake up in the middle of the night.\nThis is also the first Muse headband that can be used with the wearer’s eyes open, opening the door to a number of brain-training exercises. It’s hoped the hardware, combined with the skill games inside the app, will help improve people’s mental resilience. Not to mention, of course, helping older adults stave off cognitive decline by offering a chance to strengthen focus.\nThe Muse S Athena is available to order today from the Muse website, priced at $474.99 in the US and $574.99 in Canada.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/muses-new-wearable-eeg-knows-how-hard-youre-thinking-120041154.html?src=rss",

You can get access to the Premium Plus plan for three months for just $3, or a dollar per month. We've seen this deal a few times before. Amazon's now bringing it back in the lead up to its latest major shopping event, though you'll have until April 30 to take up the deal. You can cancel the subscription at any time. That's worth bearing in mind, as after the three months are up, the price will rise to the usual Premium Plus cost of $15 per month. \n\n The Premium Plus plan grants you one credit per month. You can use a credit to claim any audiobook you like and you'll retain access to it even after your subscription expires. In other words, you can permanently add three audiobooks to your collection for $3. The Premium Plus plan also includes access to thousands of other audiobooks. You'll also be able to listen to Audible Originals as well as podcasts through the service. All of that for a dollar a month is not a bad deal at all.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-spring-sale-deal-get-three-months-of-audible-for-only-3-145456026.html?src=rss",

    "url": "4a47347b-56e5-4db4-b940-fc42278cbcc6",
    "content": "Sony has apparently formed a new first-party studio for PlayStation called Dark Outlaw Games, and it has already started hiring personnel for it. Jason Blundell, who worked on several Call of Duty titles under Treyarch and who's perhaps best known for co-creating CoD's Zombies mode, has revealed that he's heading up the studio in an interview with Jeff Gerstmann for his podcast. As for why Sony Interactive hasn't announced the new studio yet, Blundell said that they've been \"working away in the shadows for a while\" and that they'll \"step out into the light\" when they have something to talk about.\nPresumably, that means Sony will make an official announcement once Dark Outlaw is ready to reveal its first game. Blundell didn't say if he and his team have already started developing their first title or if it even already has a project lined up. All he said was that the studio is currently \"staffing up\" and that he's \"getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking right\" and then testing them. \nBlundell worked as a programmer and a producer for Activision before joining Treyarch to work on Call of Duty. For Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, he directed and produced the Career and Zombies experiences. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020 and founded Deviation Games, which he also left in 2022 before the studio shut down two years later. According to Dark Outlaw Games' LinkedIn account, the PlayStation studio was founded in 2024, is based in Los Angeles and has a team size between 11 and 50 persons. \n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-has-a-new-first-party-playstation-studio-led-by-cod-zombies-creator-jason-blundell-120007351.html?src=rss",

    "content": "Dating—especially someone off the internet—can feel overwhelming today. The least you can do is choose an environment that makes you feel safe and comfortable.\nMore people are selecting coffee shops as a first date site, finding a more casual location to get to know someone.\nWhen you think about popular date spots, you might immediately think of a restaurant or movie theater. You know, the classic locations. But as the dating scene shifts and many of us are meeting other singles via dating apps, first-date ideas are changing, too.\nNamely, many are turning to coffeehouses.\nDinner and a Movie? Nah, This Generation Prefers Low-Commitment Coffee Dates.\nDanbi Lee, manager at the Bryant Park location of La Colombe, a staple New York City coffee shop, said she often sees over 10 first dates per week while at work.\n“Coffee shops, particularly La Colombe and many others in NYC, provide a welcoming and secure environment for dates,” she told The Post. “Their relaxed ambiance and thoughtfully spaced seating foster easy conversation, while the background music remains at a comfortable volume, eliminating the need to raise your voice as you might in a bustling bar.”\nNot just that, but coming from experience, a coffee date is also much lower stakes than, say, a full dinner date. In other words, if the other person is making you feel uncomfortable, or you’re simply not having a good time, you can excuse yourself after that quick cup of joe and spend the rest of the day contemplating life like most of us do after first dates.\nLee also recommended individuals pay attention to how their date treats the coffeehouse workers, as well as whether they respect the space.\n“If you value organization and cleanliness, take note of how your date leaves the table,” she added. “Did they tidy up after themselves, return their dirty dishes, or dispose of their trash? These seemingly minor habits often mirror how they maintain their personal space at home.”\nThe post Why Coffee Shops Are a Popular First Date Spot appeared first on VICE.",

    "url": "9d501919-7f54-4c56-8bde-df88073bd351",
    "content": "If you've ever seen Dyson's Hot+Cool Jet Focus in a store and wished the ultra-sleek appliance was more affordable, today's your lucky day. Amazon has the product, which usually costs $470, on sale for $300. That's nearly a record low. As its name suggests, the Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus can heat your room in the winter and cool it off in the summer. Its fan mode includes Air Multiplier tech, which creates a smooth and uninterrupted airstream thanks to its lack of traditional fan blades. When you need some warmth, its ceramic plates heat up quickly. \n\n The appliance has two modes: focused and diffused. Focused mode warms or cools one person, while diffused mode heats your entire room or provides a gentle breeze during the summer. It oscillates at a 70-degree angle. Dyson's fan has a sleep timer with a shutoff range between 15 minutes and nine hours, and you can store its curved and magnetized remote control inside the appliance to help prevent it from being lost. The lowest we've ever seen this product's price drop is $280, so being able to snag it for $300 in the middle of March, when we're nowhere near Black Friday or Prime Day, is about as good a deal as you can hope for.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/this-dyson-heater-and-fan-is-36-percent-off-in-the-amazon-spring-sale-173031934.html?src=rss",

    "content": "Starting Tuesday, Disney+ has a 24/7 streaming channel for The Simpsons that broadcasts seasons one through 35 (all but the currently airing one) chronologically. To be clear, this announcement isn't about any new content, as you can already watch each of those 767 episodes on-demand on Disney+. All that's different here is a single stream that runs through each of them in order around the clock. If episodes average 22 minutes long, that would have the stream taking nearly 12 days to refresh. \nThe advantage for those who like this format (I can only guess) is you don't have to think about where to pick up; just turn on the stream and imagine you're popping in on The Cartoon Network's longest marathon ever. \"The Simpsons Stream will deliver a Simpsons marathon all day, every day — no matter when you tune in, this ultimate Simpsons binge will be there,\" current show-runner Matt Selman wrote in a press release. \n This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-adds-a-247-stream-of-the-simpsons-203929882.html?src=rss",
