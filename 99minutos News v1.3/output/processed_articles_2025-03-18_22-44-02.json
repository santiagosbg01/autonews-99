    "title": "Will there be Adolescence season 2? Here’s what we know about the Netflix series",
    "url": "https://www.merca20.com/?p=12473748",
    "content": "Photo: Netflix\nThe most recent miniseries from Netflix, starring Stephen Graham, premiered on Thursday, March 13, and has already become the most-watched on the streaming platform. Many are now wondering if there will be Adolescence season 2.\nThis psychological drama has captivated audiences, and now fans want to know more about the characters’ stories and are eagerly calling on Netflix to renew the series for (at least) one more season. But is this possible? Here’s what we know.\nWill there be Adolescence season 2 on Netflix?\n(SPOILER ALERT!) The miniseries ends when Jamie pleads guilty, and his parents feel overwhelming guilt for what happened and for not paying enough attention to their son to recognize what he had been going through.\nGiven how it ended, it is unlikely that the story will continue, as it already has a definitive conclusion. Additionally, the production is in miniseries format, which typically tells the whole story in just a few episodes.\nHowever, Netflix has renewed some miniseries (so this wouldn’t be the first), and after the miniseries’ conclusion, there are still many unanswered questions. So, fans of the story can have a glimmer of hope that there may be Adolescence season 2. That said, before getting too excited, we must wait for Netflix to make an official announcement.\nREAD ALSO When will the 2026 Oscars take place? Date, host, and everything you need to know\nWhat is the miniseries Adolescence about?\nThe series comes from the collaboration between Graham and Philip Barantini, with a script by Jack Thorne. The production was carried out by a renowned team that includes Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner, and Dede Gardner.\nThe story focuses on Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), a 13-year-old teenager accused of murdering a schoolmate. This event deeply impacts his family and challenges the judicial system, while a detective and a psychologist attempt to uncover the truth.\nStephen Graham plays Eddie Miller, a father who bears the heavy suspicion about his son. Ashley Walters takes on the role of Inspector Luke Bascombe, in charge of the investigation, and Erin Doherty portrays Briony Ariston, the therapist assigned to the case.\nThroughout the series, the audience is drawn into a tense environment where every clue could be a trick and every testimony, an incomplete truth. It is certainly a must-watch series for those who haven’t enjoyed it yet.\nWhat could the Adolescence season 2 be about?\nAdolescence left numerous unresolved questions. Fans are curious about how Katie’s parents handled the situation. The fate of Ryan, Jamie’s friend, is also left up in the air. And of course, there’s the question of the possible sentence Jamie may face. All of these aspects could lead to new episodes in a hypothetical second season.\nHow many episodes does the miniseries Adolescence have?\nThe miniseries consists of only 4 episodes, each approximately 1 hour long.\nAdolescence: Full cast\nStephen Graham shares screen time with other renowned actors and some newcomers to acting. Here is the main cast of the series:\n\nOwen Cooper as the alleged teenage murderer Jamie Miller\nStephen Graham as Eddie Miller, Jamie’s father\nAshley Walters as Inspector Detective Luke Bascombe\nErin Doherty as Briony Ariston, the clinical psychologist assigned to Jamie’s case\nFaye Marsay\nChristine Tremarco\nMark Stanley\nJo Hartley\nAmélie Pease\n\nIs Adolescence based on a true story?\nAlthough Jamie’s story is not based on a real person or event, the concept of the series originated from reports that co-creator Graham heard in the news about minors involved in knife-related crimes.\n⇒ SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CONTENT ON GOOGLE NEWS",

    "content": "Italian newspaper Il Foglio claims to have published the world's first entirely AI-generated edition as part of a month-long experiment to explore AI's impact on journalism. The special four-page supplement, available in print and online, features AI-written articles, headlines, and reader letters. The only thing the human journalists provided were prompts. The Guardian reports: The front page of the first edition of Il Foglio AI carries a story referring to the US president, Donald Trump, describing the \"paradox of Italian Trumpians\" and how they rail against \"cancel culture\" yet either turn a blind eye, or worse, \"celebrate\" when \"their idol in the US behaves like the despot of a banana republic.\" The front page also features a column headlined \"Putin, the 10 betrayals,\" with the article highlighting \"20 years of broken promises, torn-up agreements and words betrayed\" by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.\nIn a rare upbeat story about the Italian economy, another article points to the latest report from Istat, the national statistics agency, on the redistribution of income, which shows the country \"is changing, and not for the worse\" with salary increases for about 750,000 workers being among the positive effects of income tax reforms. On page 2 is a story about \"situationships\" and how young Europeans are fleeing steady relationships. The articles were structured, straightforward and clear, with no obvious grammatical errors. However, none of the articles published in the news pages directly quote any human beings.\nThe final page runs AI-generated letters from readers to the editor, with one asking whether AI will render humans \"useless\" in the future. \"AI is a great innovation, but it doesn't yet know how to order a coffee without getting the sugar wrong,\" reads the AI-generated response.\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",
